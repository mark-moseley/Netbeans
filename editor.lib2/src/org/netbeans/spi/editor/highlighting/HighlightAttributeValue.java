/**
 * Lazy evaluator for attribute values. It is up to each particular attribute
 * to declare if its values can be lazily evaluated. Attributes that declare
 * themselvs as supporting lazy evaluation can have their values specified either
 * directly or through <code>HighlightAttributeValue</code>. All users of such an attribute
 * must check for both the direct value and the lazy evaluator and use them
 * accordingly.
 * 
 * <p class="nonnormative">If an attribute supports
 * lazy evaluation the result of <code>getValue</code> call should have the same
 * type as if the attribute value were specified directly. For example, the
 * <code>EditorStyleConstants.Tooltip</code> attribute supports lazy evaluation
 * and its value can either be <code>String</code> or <code>HighlightAttributeValue&lt;String&gt;</code>.
