<h2>XML Entity Catalog SPI</h2>

<p><b>Maintainer</b>: Petr Kuzel
<p><b>Updated on</b>: 31st June 2001


<h2>SPI Overview</h2>

The SPI is very simple, there is only one mandatory interface
to be implemented. Then the implementation must be integrated
with IDE.


<h2>SPI Implementator Guide</h2>

<p>Every SPI implementation must implement interface
{@link org.netbeans.modules.xml.catalog.spi.CatalogReader CatalogReader}
allowing quering catalog for entries, refreshing its content and optionaly
listening on its content.

<p>An SPI implementation should implement following interfaces:
<ul>
<li>{@link org.netbeans.modules.xml.catalog.spi.CatalogDescriptor CatalogDescriptor} describing catalog instance
<li>{@link org.netbeans.modules.xml.catalog.spi.CatalogWriter CatalogWriter} allowing to modify catalog entries
<li>SAX's org.xml.sax.EntityResolver if it can resolve more complicated cases than public => system ID mappings
</ul>


<h3>NetBeans IDE Platform Integration</h3>

An SPI implementation can register its availability using NetBeans <b>Lookup</b>.
A module providing a new SPI implementation registers its avaiability using
{@link org.netbeans.modules.xml.catalog.spi.CatalogProvider CatalogProvider}</b> 
instance (declared at its XML Layer):

<pre>
  &lt;folder name="Services">
    &lt;folder name="Hidden">
      &lt;file name="my-company-netbeans-catalog-impl-MyProvider.instance" />
    &lt;/filder>
  &lt;/folder>
</pre>

Where <tt>my.company.netbeans.catalog.impl.MyProvider</tt> public no-arg constructor 
class implements the <tt>CatalogProvider</tt> interface.

<p>Using <code>CatalogProvider</code> just provides a kind of factory, so that the user can add one or more
instances of the catalog at will. You may instead register a <code>CatalogReader</code> instance directly in
your layer in the folder <code>Plugins/XML/UserCatalogs/</code>; such catalogs will be preinstalled and not
deletable.</p>

<h3>Forte for Java 3.0 Specifics Feature</h3>

If a catalog implements <tt>Serializable</tt> interface then
its mounting point is <b>persistent</b> among IDE restarts. In such case it is
highly recommended to explicitly declare <tt>serialVersionUID</tt> field.
