<!---
  MIME component checking XML resource header, permitting matches against
  XML constructs: processing instructions, document type declarations, and root element (start tag).
  <p>
  <samp>PUBLIC "-//NetBeans//DTD MIME Resolver XML Rules 1.0//EN"</samp>
  </p>
  It should work well for:
  <dl>
  <dt>Well-formed document type detection</dt>
  <dd>Using: PIs, root element name and root element attributes.</dd>
  <dt>DTD-constrained document detection</dt>
  <dd>Using: PIs and DOCTYPE public IDs.</dd>
  <dt>NS-constrained documents</dt>
  <dd>Using: PIs and root element namespaces.</dd>
  </dl>
-->
<!ELEMENT xml-rule (pi*, doctype?, element?)>

<!---
  Processing instructions can be tested on target and pseudo-attributes.
  <p>
  It should be used for in-band tagging that is specified by some
  accepted specification. For NetBeans-specific tagging of third party standards it is
  recommended to use out-of-band tagging such as <code>FileObject</code> attributes.
  </p>
-->
<!ELEMENT pi (attr*) >
<!ATTLIST pi target CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!---
  Match one of the DOCTYPE's public IDs.
  Use of <code>public-id</code> subelements is mutually exclusive with the attribute.
-->
<!ELEMENT doctype (public-id*) >
<!ATTLIST doctype public-id CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!---
  A public ID is checked for an exact match.
-->
<!ELEMENT public-id EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST public-id id CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!---
  Matches a root element by specified name, attributes or namespace.
  <p>
  The namespace <code>ns</code> attribute or the presence of any <code>ns</code> subelements 
  implies that the <code>name</code> attribute represents a local element name,
  otherwise the <code>name</code> attribute represents a full element name ("QName").
  One of the namespaces must match.
  </p>
-->
<!ELEMENT element (ns*, attr*)>
<!ATTLIST element ns CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST element name CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!---
  Test namespace equality (exact match).
-->
<!ELEMENT ns EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST ns ns CDATA #REQUIRED>


<!---
  Element attribute template, also used for pseudo-attributes in processing instructions.
  <p>
  The <code>name</code> attribute contains the full attribute name (QName).
  This is inteded to be used for documents that cannot be indentified by public ID nor
  root element namespace.
  </p>
  If <code>text</code> is specified then the attribute's normalized text must
  exactly match the specified text, otherwise the attribute just needs to be present.

<!ATTLIST attr name CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST attr text CDATA #IMPLIED>
