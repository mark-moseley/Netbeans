/** Represents an acquired lock on a <code>FileObject</code>.
* Typical usage includes locking the file in the editor on first
* modification, and then using this object to ensure exclusive access when
* overwriting the file (saving) by using {@link FileObject#getOutputStream}.
* Also used for renames, deletes, &amp;c.
* <p>Note that such locks are only used to protect against concurrent write accesses,
* and are not used for read operations (i.e. they are <em>not</em> write-one-read-many locks).
* Normally this is sufficient protection. If you really need an atomic read, you may
* simply lock the file, perform the read, and unlock it when done. The file will still
* be protected against writes, although the read operation did not request a lock.
