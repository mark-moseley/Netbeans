               The bug - if new Thread(...) call is issued and the thread is not started.
               The thread is added as a member to its thread group - such threads are counted in
               calls activeCount() and enumerate(Thread[] ts, ...) although they do not live - e.g
               call destroy() to threadgroup always throws an exception. Solution is to start suspicious
               threads. I added try - catch block for already started threads.
               This is patch for some code used inside Swing - code like this " ... = new Thread().getThreadGroup();"
               see - javax.swing.SystemEventQueueUtilities$RunnableCanvas.maybeRegisterEventDispatchThread()
               Original error was that TaskThreadGroups that had not any threads at thread dump were not removed.
               !!! remove spagetti code if the bug is repaired in JDK.
