Structure of XML files present in a NetBeans installation
with names system/ModuleAutoDeps/*.xml (conventionally named
according to code name base, e.g. org-netbeans-modules-foo.xml).

Each file contribute some module dependency transformations
to the system, helping backward compatibility.

<!ENTITY % dependency 'module-dependency | package-dependency | token-dependency'>

<!---
A set of transformations to apply to all module dependencies,
to retain backward compatibility during refactorings.
This should be the root element of auto-deps.xml.
Note that transformations are applied <em>in parallel</em>, so
later transformations cannot be triggered by results from earlier
transformations.
-->
<!ELEMENT transformations (transformationgroup*)>
<!ATTLIST transformations
          version (1.0) #REQUIRED
>

<!---
A module to exclude from dependency transformation.
You may give a specific module, or all modules whose code name base
begins with some prefix.
(For prefix: name <samp>a.b</samp> matches the module named
<samp>a.b</samp> and all modules whose names start with <samp>a.b.</samp>.)
-->
<!ELEMENT exclusion EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST exclusion
          codenamebase CDATA #REQUIRED
          prefix (true | false) #REQUIRED
>

<!---
A group of transformations to apply, related to one another.
-->
<!ELEMENT transformationgroup (description, exclusion*, transformation+)>

<!---
Textual description of a transformation group.
Informational only.
-->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

<!---
One dependency transformation.
Each non-excluded module matching the trigger will
get the specified resulting dependencies.
-->
<!ELEMENT transformation (trigger-dependency, implies)>

<!---
The trigger for a transformation.
Contains an old dependency declaration.
Cancel triggers match when the module had that dependency
(if versioned, must be at least that new, in both major and spec)
and when matching, delete the old dependency.
Older triggers match when the dependency was there but on an older
version than the one specified. (Should use a spec dep normally;
no version at all matches only plain or spec deps on an earlier major version).
-->
<!ELEMENT trigger-dependency (%dependency;)>
<!-- add as needed: (newer | negative)
Newer triggers match when the module had that dependency
(if it was versioned, must be at least that new, in both major and spec).
Negative triggers match if the module did not have it.
-->
<!ATTLIST trigger-dependency
          type (cancel | older) #REQUIRED
>

<!---
Dependencies to create as a result of this transformation.
-->
<!ELEMENT implies (result+)>

<!---
One dependency to create as a result of this transformation.
If the module already had a dependency on the specified object (module, ...),
and that dependency was older than the specified one,
then it will be <em>replaced</em> by the specified dependency.
Otherwise a fresh dependency will be added.
-->
<!ELEMENT result (%dependency;)>

<!---
A dependency on a module, similar to
<code>OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies</code>.
Never applies to implementation dependencies.
For <code>OpenIDE-Module-IDE-Dependencies</code>,
use codenamebase=org.openide (and major=1).
-->
<!ELEMENT module-dependency EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST module-dependency
          codenamebase CDATA #REQUIRED
          major CDATA #IMPLIED
          spec CDATA #IMPLIED
>

<!---
A dependency on a package, similar to
<code>OpenIDE-Module-Package-Dependencies</code>.
Never applies to implementation dependencies.
<code>name</code> here may include sample class information
only when used in a result, not in a trigger!
-->
<!ELEMENT package-dependency EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST package-dependency
          name CDATA #REQUIRED
          spec CDATA #IMPLIED
>

<!---
A dependency on a token, similar to
<code>OpenIDE-Module-Requires</code>.
-->
<!ELEMENT token-dependency EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST token-dependency
          name CDATA #REQUIRED
>
