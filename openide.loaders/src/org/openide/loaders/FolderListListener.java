/** Listener that watches progress of recognizing objects
* in a folder. The listener may even influence the data object recognition
* and, in such a way, act as a filter.
*
* <p>Normally the methods of this class are called in the process of a task
* to collect the data objects within a folder, e.g. in
* {@link FolderList#computeChildrenList(FolderListListener)}. In such a task
* implementations of {@link #process(DataObject, java.util.List)} may act as
* filters by not added the data object to the result list. Implementations
* of {@link #finished(java.util.List)} may be used to inform the caller about
* the result of the task and for further processing of the result. E.g.
* {@link FolderList#computeChildrenList(FolderListListener)} has as its return
* value the task to compute the list and not the computed children. An
* implementation of {@link #finished(java.util.List)} may be used by the caller
* of {@link FolderList#computeChildrenList(FolderListListener)} to get informed
* about the result of children computation.</p>
