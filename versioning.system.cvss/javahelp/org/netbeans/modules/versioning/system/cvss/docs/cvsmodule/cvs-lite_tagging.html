        <h2>Working with Tags</h2>
        <p>It is often helpful to tag version controlled files for reference purposes, 
        when you want to mark the point a particular branch was made, for example. 
        Using the CVS Tag command you can attach an existing tag to a file or folder 
        or create a new tag.</p>

        <p><b>To apply a tag to a file or directory:</b>
        <ol>
        <li>Right-click the file or folder and choosing CVS &gt; Tag.
        <li>Enter the tag name in the text field. Alternately, 
        you can click Browse to choose from a list of existing tags.
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If the tag you entered does not already exist, a new tag will be created.
            </ul>
        <li>If you want to ensure that the tag is not attached to local revisions that 
        are not up to date, select the Avoid Tagging Locally Modified Files checkbox.
        <li>If you want to move an existing tag to the current revision in your local 
        working directory, select the Move Existing Tags checkbox.
        <p>The IDE attaches the tag on the specified file or directory.
        </ol>
