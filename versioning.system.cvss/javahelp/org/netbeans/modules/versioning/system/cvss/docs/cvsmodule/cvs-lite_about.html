        <h2>About Version Control </h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p> Version control systems (VCS) aid developer groups working with shared
        	source files in common repositories by managing file revision history
        	information. The IDE's CVS support provides a means of effectively
        	managing changes to version-controlled files. </p>
        <p>In the IDE, you can call CVS commands on both files and directories
        	in the Projects, Files, Versioning,  and Favorites window.
        	To work with CVS in the IDE, you need to  register a  local
        	working directory. For more information, see <a href="cvs-lite_setup.html">Setting
        	Up CVS.</a></li>
        </ul>
