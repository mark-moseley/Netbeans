<h2>About Version Control </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> Version control systems (VCS) aid developer groups working with
shared source files in common repositories by managing file revision
history information. The IDE's CVS built-in support enables you to
manage changes to version-controlled files as you work. </p>
<p>In the IDE, you can call CVS commands on both files and directories
in the Projects, Files, Versioning, and Favorites window. For an
overview of the typical workflow when using CVS in the IDE, see <a
 href="cvs-lite_overview.html">Working with CVS.</a> </p>
<h3>The IDE's CVS Tools</h3>
<p>The IDE provides several tools to simplify the process of working
with version controlled files including: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Versioning Window</b>. Provides an <a
