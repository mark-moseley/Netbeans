	<h2>CVS: Branch Dialog Box</h2>
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
	<p>The CVS Branch  dialog box enables you to specify the branch when creating
		a new branch or adding files to an existing branch.</p>
	<p>You access this dialog box by right-clicking a file or folder and selecting CVS &gt; Branch.</p>
	<p>Specify the following in the Branch dialog box:</p>	
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Branch name.</b> Enter a branch name in the text field or click Browse to see a list of available branches.
	    Entering a new branch name creates a new branch.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When creating a new branch or moving files or folders to an existing branch, you can set the following options:</p>
	<ul>	
	    <li><b>Tag Before Branching.</b> If selected, the name specified in the Tag Name text field is attached to the root of the branch. 
	    This can be useful for marking where the branch was made.
	    The branch is created after the tag is attached to the file or folder.</li>
	    <li><b>Switch to This Branch Afterwards.</b> If selected, the local working directory is switched to the specified branch after the branch is created.</li>
	</ul>
