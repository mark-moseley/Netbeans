	<h2>CVS: Merge Conflicts Resolver</h2>
	<p>Use the Merge Conflicts Resolver to resolve conflicts between version-controlled files before committing files to the repository.</p>
	
	<p>When merge conflicts occur, a Merge Conflict badge (<img src="../images/badgeMergeConflict.gif" alt="Merge Conflict Badge">) appears on the file's node.
	To resolve merge conflicts in the Merge Conflicts Resolver, right-click the file with the conflict and choose CVS &gt; Resolve Conflicts.</p> 
 	<p>The Merge Conflicts Resolver displays the two conflicting revisions side by side, with the conflicting areas highlighted.
	You resolve the conflicts by accepting one of the revisions. Once all conflicts are resolved, click OK.</p>
	<p>For more, see <a href="../cvs-lite_mergeresolve.html">Resolving Merge Conflicts</a>.</p>
