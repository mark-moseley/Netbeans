	<h2>CVS: Merge Conflicts Resolver</h2>
        
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
	<p>The Merge Conflicts Resolver enables you to resolve conflicts between local copies
            of version-controlled files and the repository  before committing them.</p>
            
	<p>When merge conflicts occur, the folder containing the file with the conflict has a 
            Merge Conflict badge (<img src="../images/conflicts-badge.png" alt="Merge Conflict Badge">).
            To resolve merge conflicts in the Merge Conflicts Resolver, right-click the file with 
            the conflict and choose CVS &gt; Resolve Conflicts.</p>
            
 	<p>The Merge Conflicts Resolver displays the two conflicting revisions side by side in 
            the top pane, with the conflicting areas highlighted. You resolve a conflict by 
            accepting a revision. Click the Accept button of the revision you want to accept. 
            The IDE merges the accepted revision with the source file. You can see the results 
            of the merge in the bottom pane of the Merge Conflicts Resolver. Once all conflicts 
            are resolved, click OK to exit the Merge Conflicts Resolver and save the modified file.
            The Merge Conflict badge is removed from the file and you can now commit the modified 
            file to the repository.</p>
