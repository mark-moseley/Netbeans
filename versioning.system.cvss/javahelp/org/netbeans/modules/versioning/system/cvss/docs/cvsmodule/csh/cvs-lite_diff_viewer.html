	<h2>CVS: Diff Viewer</h2>
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
	<p>The IDE's Graphical Diff Viewer enables you to <a href="../cvs-lite_diff.html">compare file
	revisions</a> of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the
	differences between the files being compared.</p>
	<p>You access the Diff Viewer when you right-click a version-controlled file or folder and choose CVS &gt; Diff.</p>
	<p>The toolbar in the Diff Viewer enables you to do the following actions:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Choose the modified files displayed.</b>. You can choose which file revisions are being compared. 
	    When you choose Remote vs Local, the Diff Viewer compares the locally modified file to the revision in the repository.
	    When you choose Local, the Diff Viewer compares the local base file to the locally modified revision.
	    When you choose Remote, the Diff Viewer compares the revisions in the repository.</li>
	    <li><b>Choose the files displayed.</b> If you are running the diff command on multiple files, you can use the drop-down list to choose which diff is displayed.</li>
	    <li><b>Locate the next and previous modification.</b> Use the previous (<img src="../images/diff-prev.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16" width="16">) and next (<img src="../images/diff-next.png" alt="Next difference button" height="16"
	    width="16">) difference buttons to navigate among the differences in the file. </li> 
	    <li><b>Refresh the diff.</b> You can refresh the status and update files using the Refresh Diff button (<img src="../images/refresh.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16" width="16">).</li>
	    <li><b>Update file.</b> You can update the status and update files using the Update button (<img src="../images/update.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16" width="16">).</li>
	    <li><b>Commit file.</b> You	can commit your changes using the Commit button (<img src="../images/commit.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16" width="16">).</li>
	</ul>
