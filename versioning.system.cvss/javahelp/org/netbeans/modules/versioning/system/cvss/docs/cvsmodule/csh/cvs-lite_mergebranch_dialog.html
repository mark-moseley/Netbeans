        <h2>CVS: Merge Changes from Branch Dialog Box</h2>
        
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Merge Changes from Branch dialog box enables you to merge files from a
            branch or the trunk to your local working directory.</p>
          
	<p>You access this dialog box by right-clicking a versioned file or folder 
            (e.g. in the Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and choosing CVS &gt; Merge Changes from 
            Branch.</p>
            
        <p><strong>Current Working Branch</strong> is your local working directory. This field 
            contains <tt>Trunk</tt> if you are working in the trunk, or the name of a branch.</p>
            
	<p>When merging files, select one of the following:</p>
        
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Merge from Trunk</strong>. Select this to merge changes that were made 
                in the trunk to your working directory.</li>
	    <li><strong>Merge from Branch</strong>. Select this to merge changes that were made 
                in the specified branch to your working directory. When you choose this option, 
                specify the name of the branch you want to merge into your local repository.
                You can enter the name of the branch in the text field or click Browse to open 
                the Browse Tags dialog box and choose from the available branches.</li>
	</ul>
        
	<p>You can set the following options when merging files to your local repository:</p>
        
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Merge Only Changes Made after Tag</strong>. When selected, only changes 
                made after the specified tag are merged into your local repository. Enter the 
                name of the tag in the text field or click Browse to open the Browse Tags dialog 
                box and choose from the available tags. If unselected, all changes are merged into 
                your local repository.</li>
	    <li><strong>Tag Trunk After Merge</strong>. When selected, the trunk is tagged after 
                merging to mark changes you have already merged. Enter the tag to attach after 
                the merge, or click Browse to choose an existing tag. If unselected, no tag is 
                attached to the source branch.</li>
        </ul>
