        <p>Patch files enable software developers not sharing a common
        repository to distribute and integrate changes that have been made to the code
        without requiring files to be changed manually. In the IDE you can create
        and apply  patches to update source files with the differences
        automatically. </p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>The Patch command is not available when using
            the IDE's built-in CVS client.</li>
        </ul>
        <a name="CreatePatch"><h4>To create a patch file of the differences between
            a locally modified  copy of a source   and the repository revision:</h4>
        </a>
        <ol>
            <li>While pressing the Control key, right-click the locally modified file
            or folder and choose CVS&nbsp;> Diff
            Textual. </li>
            <li>In the Diff dialog box, identify the revision numbers or dates of the versions
            you want to compare.
            <ul>
                <li>If you want to compare your working copy with the revision in the repository
                upon which your working copy is based, click OK without entering any data.
                <li>If you want to compare your working copy with any other revision in the
                repository, click Select to select a revision or tag from the chooser.
                Alternately, you can enter the revision or tag information in the Revision
                or Tag text field. <p><b>Note:</b> The HEAD revision is the latest revision that has been
                committed to the repository.
            </ul>
            Then click OK.
            <li>In the VCS Output window, ensure that  the correct differences are shown.</li>
            <li>Right-click in the output pane and choose Save To File from the contextual
            menu.</li>
            <li>In the Save Command Output to File dialog, enter the  name
                of the patch	file and click OK.
                <p>A patch file is created in the specified location containing the differences
                between the source code file versions. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To create a patch file of the differences between two repository revisions
        of a source file:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the source files from whose differences  you wish to generate the
            patch. </li>
            <li>Right-click  either of the files and choose
            CVS&nbsp;> Patch from
            the contextual menu. </li>
            <li> In the Patch dialog box, specify the style of  diff output and 
            the revisions you want to compare.
            <p>Choose from the following options:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Context Format.</b> The output shows each difference surrounded
                by two lines of contextual text.</li>
                <li><b>Unidiff Format.</b> The output shows line numbers of every difference
                surrounded by a pair of at-signs (<tt>@@</tt>). Lines where text has
                been added are marked with a plus sign (<tt>+</tt>) and lines where text
                has been deleted are marked with a minus sign (<tt>-</tt>).</li>
                <li><b>Short Patch.</b> The output shows every difference as one line only.</li>
                <li><b>Top Two Diffs.</b> The diff is between the two latest revisions
                of the file or folder.</li>
                <li><b>Revision or Tag.</b> The revision number or tag of the first version
                of the file or folder to use to create the diff output. For a file (not
                a folder), click Select to select the desired revision or tag in the
                chooser. </li>
                <li><b>Date.</b> The timestamp of the first version of the file or folder
                to use to create the diff.</li>
                <li><b>The HEAD Revision.</b> The latest revision of the file or folder
                committed to the repository. </li>
                <li><b>Revision or Tag 2.</b> The revision number or tag of the second
                version of the file or folder to use to create the diff output. For a
                file (not a folder), click Select to select the desired revision or tag
                in a chooser.</li>
                <li><b>Date 2.</b> The timestamp of the second version of the file or folder
                to use to create the diff.</li>
            </ul>
   
            <li> Click OK.</li>
            <li>In the VCS Output window, ensure that the correct differences are shown.</li>
            <li>Right-click in the output and choose Save To File from the contextual menu.
                <p>A patch file is created in the specified location containing the differences
                between the source code file versions.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>The CVS&nbsp;> Patch
            command runs on file versions in the repository, not on files in your
            local working directory.</li>

        <li>Type the path or navigate to the patch file you want to apply. </li>
        <li>Click Patch.<p>The differences contained in the patch file are incorporated
            into the file or folder. You should always verify that the patched file
            or folder contains the changes from the patch file after using the Apply
            Patch command.
        </li></ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Because  patches on folders use relative paths
            to the files within them, folder patches must
            be applied on the same folder node that the patch was created on to insure
            the patch is applied properly.</li>
