<h2>Creating and Applying a Patch</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Patch files enable software developers who are not sharing a common
repository to distribute and integrate changes that have been made to
the code. The IDE
enables you to create and apply patches that update copies of source
files so that you do not have to incorporate the changes manually. </p>
<a name="CreatePatch"></a>
<h4>To create a patch file of the differences between a locally
modified copy of a file and the repository version:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Select the file or folder for which you want to create a patch in
the Projects, Files, or Favorites window. </li>
  <li>Choose CVS&nbsp;&gt; Export <tt>&lt;file_name&gt;</tt> Diff
Patch. </li>
  <li>Enter a name for the patch file and specify the location where
you want to save the patch. </li>
  <li>Click Export.
    <p>A patch file is created in the specified location containing the
differences between the source file versions. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Note that the Export Diff
Patch command is only available on files for which either the local or
remote copies have changes which have not alreaady been merged.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<!--<h4>To create a patch file of the differences between two repository revisions
        of a source file:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the source files from whose differences  you wish to generate the
            patch. </li>
            <li>Right-click  either of the files and choose
            CVS&nbsp;> Patch from
            the contextual menu. </li>
            <li> In the Patch dialog box, specify the style of  diff output and 
            the revisions you want to compare.
            <p>Choose from the following options:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Context Format.</b> The output shows each difference surrounded
                by two lines of contextual text.</li>
                <li><b>Unidiff Format.</b> The output shows line numbers of every difference
                surrounded by a pair of at-signs (<tt>@@</tt>). Lines where text has
                been added are marked with a plus sign (<tt>+</tt>) and lines where text
                has been deleted are marked with a minus sign (<tt>-</tt>).</li>
                <li><b>Short Patch.</b> The output shows every difference as one line only.</li>
                <li><b>Top Two Diffs.</b> The diff is between the two latest revisions
                of the file or folder.</li>
                <li><b>Revision or Tag.</b> The revision number or tag of the first version
                of the file or folder to use to create the diff output. For a file (not
                a folder), click Select to select the desired revision or tag in the
                chooser. </li>
                <li><b>Date.</b> The timestamp of the first version of the file or folder
                to use to create the diff.</li>
                <li><b>The HEAD Revision.</b> The latest revision of the file or folder
                committed to the repository. </li>
                <li><b>Revision or Tag 2.</b> The revision number or tag of the second
                version of the file or folder to use to create the diff output. For a
                file (not a folder), click Select to select the desired revision or tag
                in a chooser.</li>
                <li><b>Date 2.</b> The timestamp of the second version of the file or folder
                to use to create the diff.</li>
            </ul>
   
            <li> Click OK.</li>
            <li>In the VCS Output window, ensure that the correct differences are shown.</li>
            <li>Right-click in the output and choose Save To File from the contextual menu.
                <p>A patch file is created in the specified location containing the differences
                between the source code file versions.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>The CVS&nbsp;> Patch
            command runs on file versions in the repository, not on files in your
            local working directory.</li>

        <a name="ApplyPatch"><h4>To apply a patch to a file or a folder: </h4></a>
        <ol>
        <li>Right-click the file or folder on which you want to apply the patch and
        choose Tools&nbsp;> Apply&nbsp;Patch. </li>
        <li>Type the path or navigate to the patch file you want to apply. </li>
        <li>Click Patch.<p>The differences contained in the patch file are incorporated
            into the file or folder. You should always verify that the patched file
            or folder contains the changes from the patch file after using the Apply
            Patch command.

them, folder patches must be applied on the same folder node that the
patch was created on to insure the patch is applied properly.</li>
