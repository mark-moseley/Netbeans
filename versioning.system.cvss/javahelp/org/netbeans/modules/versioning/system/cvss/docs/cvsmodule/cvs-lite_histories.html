<h2>Working with Version Histories</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Searching the histories of files can be helpful when you need to
find specific commits, when fixing bugs for example. <br>
</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Viewing File's Version History<br>
</span></h3>
The IDE's Search
Histories window enables you to view a summary of a file's evolution
over time by revision number. You can open the Search History window by
choosing CVS &gt; Search History. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>You can compare a file with previous versions from within the
Search Histories window using the Diff button. <br>
<br>
To view revision differences in the Search History window:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Click the Diff button in the toolbar.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Select the revision against which you want to compare your local
working copy.</li>
  <li>The IDE displays a diff of the file's revisions within the Search
History window. Note that you can navigate between the differences
using the Previous Difference and Next
Difference buttons.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Searching for Specific Revisions</span><br>
</h3>
<p>Using the Search History window, you can search a file's history for
versions based on several criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Search Histories window enables you to search for changes in

commit.<!--Indicates lines that have been changed
since the earlier revision.-->
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Username</strong>. The author of the commit.<!--Indicates lines that have been added
since the earlier revision.-->
  </li>
  <li><strong>From Tag</strong>. The tag, branch, or date from which
the commit was made.</li>
  <li><b>To Tag. </b>The tag, branch, or date before which the commit
was made.<!--Indicates lines that have been added
since the earlier revision.--><strong><br>
    </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To search for a revision:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the file for which you want to find a specific revision.</li>
  <li>Choose CVS &gt; Search <tt>filename</tt> History from the main
menu.</li>
  <p>The IDE displays the file's revision history in the Search
History window. </p>
  <li>Enter search criteria information in the Message, Name, From, and
To fields. You can use the Browse buttons to designate any tag, branch,
revision, or date you want to limit your search to.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Click Search.</li>
  <p>The IDE displays the file's revision history in the Search
History window.</p>
</ol>
<p>If you want to view other files that were included in a specific
commit, you can broaden your search using the "your_project" and Open
Projects links to the right of each revision.
