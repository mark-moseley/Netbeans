        <h2>Using CVS with the IDE </h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The IDE's CVS support enables you to manage the evolution of changes
        in version-controlled files by displaying status information directly
        in the IDE's various windows (Projects, Files, Versioning, etc.) so
        that you can call CVS commands as you work.</p>
        
        <h3>Tracking Changes in the Versioning Window </h3>
        <p>The Versioning window presents a real-time view of the changes in
        selected directories that distinguishes between file revisions using color
        coding and font styles. Current CVS file status is also indicated by adding badges
        to project, package and directory icons that contain modified files. By default, the Versioning window opens at the 
        bottom of the IDE whenever you view changes. </p>
        <p>To open the Versioning window, choose CVS &gt; Show
        All Changes. Alternately, you can right-click any project,
        directory, or file that is in a CVS working directory and choose CVS
        &gt; Show Changes. </p>
        
        <p>Using the filter buttons in the toolbar,
        you can limit the list of displayed files to either locally or remotely
        modified files. The Versioning window toolbar also includes buttons
        that enable you to invoke the most common CVS tasks on all files
        displayed in the list. </p>
        
        <h3>Calling Version Control Commands</h3>
        <p>You can call CVS commands on versioned-controlled files (those
        exisiting within a registered working directory) using the CVS menu in
        the IDE's main window. In addition, many CVS commands are available in
        the CVS commands submenu for the currently selected file or directory. </p>
        <p>You can access the CVS commands submenu by right-clicking a file or
        directory in any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Projects window</b></li>
            <li><b>Files window</b></li>
            <li><b>Favorites window </b></li>
            <li><b>Versioning window</b></li>
            <li><b>Search Histories window </b></li>
            <li><b>Search Results window</b></li>
            <li><b>Source Editor</b>
            <p>The Status Bar in the bottom left of the IDE window displays the
            current command's status. </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following common CVS commands are available in the Versioning window's toolbar: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Refresh Status.</b></li>
            <li><b>Diff All.</b></li>
            <li><b>Update All.</b></li>
            <li><strong>Commit All.</strong></li>
        </ul>
