        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>When merge conflicts occur, a Merge Conflict badge (<img src="images/conflicts-badge.png" 
            alt="Merge Conflict Badge">) appears on the parent folder (or package) 
            of file. Within the file itself, each conflict is marked with arrows 
            followed by the lines from the two revisions that caused the conflict.</p>
            
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Merge conflicts must be resolved prior to checking your local file 
                into the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To resolve merge conflicts graphically with the Merge Conflicts Resolver:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the node of the file whose status indicates that there 
                is a conflict and choose Resolve Conflicts from the pop-up menu.
                The Merge Conflicts Resolver is displayed with merge conflicts
                highlighted in red.</li>
            <li>Use the Next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="Next">) and Previous 
                (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="Previous">) difference buttons 
                in the upper-left corner to navigate to each conflict in the file.</li>
            <li>For each conflict, click Accept above the pane containing the text 
                that you wish to accept. Once you have chosen the correct text, it 
                is highlighted in green and displayed in the Merge Result pane. The 
                text you did not choose is highlighted in blue.</li>
            <li>If neither pane contains the text you want, exit the Merge Conflict 
                Resolver and edit your source file manually. When you are done making 
                changes, right-click the node of the file and choose CVS &gt; Update 
                from the contextual menu. Then repeat the procedure, beginning from 
                Step 1.</li>
            <li>After resolving each conflict, click OK to exit the Merge Conflict 
                Resolver. The IDE updates your local working copy with the desired
                changes.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can also resolve conflicts manually in the Source Editor. To do 
                so, open the file in the editor. For each conflict in the file, delete
                the arrows and text that you do not want, then save the file. The 
                IDE updates your local working copy with the desired changes.</li>
            <li>Once you have resolved each merge conflict, you still need to
                <a href="cvs-lite_commit.html">commit</a> the file to add your changes 
                to the repository copy.</li>
