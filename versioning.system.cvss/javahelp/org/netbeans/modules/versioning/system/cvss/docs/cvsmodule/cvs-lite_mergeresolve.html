        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When merge conflicts occur, a Merge Conflict badge (<img
        src="./images/conflicts-badge.png" alt="Merge Conflict Badge">)
        appears on the parent folder (or package) of file. Within the file itself, 
        each conflict is marked with arrows followed by the lines from the two 
        revisions that caused the conflict. </p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Merge conflicts must be resolved prior to checking your local
            file into the repository. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>To resolve merge conflicts graphically with the Merge Conflicts
        Resolver:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the node of the file whose status indicates that
                there is a conflict and choose Resolve Conflicts from the pop-up menu.
                <p>The Merge Conflicts Resolver is displayed with merge conflicts
                highlighted in red. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Use the Next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="Next"
            height="16" width="16">) and Previous (<img src="images/diff-prev.png"
            alt="Previous" height="16" width="16">) difference buttons in the
            upper-lefthand corner to navigate to each conflict in the file. </li>
            <li>For each conflict, click Accept above the pane containing the
                text that you wish to accept.
                <p>Once you have chosen the correct text, it is highlighted in
                green and displayed in the Merge Result pane. The text you did not
                choose is highlighted in blue. </p>
            </li>
            <li>If neither pane contains the text you want, exit the Merge
            Conflict Resolver and edit your source file manually. When you are done
            making changes, right-click the node of the file and choose
            CVS&nbsp;&gt; Update from the contextual menu. Then repeat the
            procedure, beginning with Step 1. </li>
            <li>After resolving each conflict, click OK to exit the Merge
                Conflict Resolver.
                <p>The IDE updates your local working copy with the desired
                changes. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <!--<h4>To resolve conflicts manually in the source file:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Open the file in the editor.
        <li>For each conflict in the file, delete the arrows and  text that
        you do not want.
        <li>Save the file.<p>The IDE updates your local working copy with the desired
        changes. </ol>-->
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Once you have resolved each merge conflict, you still need to
            commit the file to add your changes to the repository copy. For more
