	<h2>CVS: Versioning Window</h2>
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
	<p>The Versioning window presents a real-time view of the changes in
	selected directories. It opens at the bottom of the IDE whenever you
	view changes made in version-controlled files.</p>
	<p>To open the Versioning window, choose CVS &gt; Show
	All Changes. Alternately, you can right-click any project, directory,
	or file that is in a CVS working directory and choose CVS &gt; Show
	Changes.</p>

	<p>By default, the
	Versioning window displays a list of all modified files within the
	selected package or folder. Using the filter buttons in the toolbar,
	you can limit the list of displayed files to either locally or remotely
	modified files. 
	You can click the column headings above the listed files to sort the files.</p>
	<p>The Versioning window toolbar also includes buttons that enable you to invoke the most common CVS tasks on all files displayed in the list.
	The following CVS commands are available in the toolbar of the Versioning window: </p>
	<ul>
	    <li><b>Refresh Status.</b></li>
	    <li><b>Diff All.</b></li>
	    <li><b>Update All.</b></li>
	    <li><b>Commit All.</b></li>
	</ul>

	<p>You can access CVS commands in the Versioning window by right-clicking the file and choosing a command in the pop-up window.
	You can also specify files that you want to exclude from a commit or to ignore altogether by right-clicking the file and then choosing Exclude from Commit or Ignore.
	<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
	<ul class="note"><li>You can also exclude files from a commit in the Commit dialog box.</li>
	    <li>You can select multiple files in the Versioning window by holding down the Ctrl key when you select the files.</li>
	</ul>
