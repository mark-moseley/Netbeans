        <p>The Merge command is useful for 
        incorporating changes in earlier revisions into your working copy. You
        can merge  revisions on different branches of the repository with your
        local working copy of a file or directory. You can also  merge the difference
        between two earlier revisions with your
        local working copy. </p>

        <h4>To merge an earlier revision with your working copy:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Versioning window, expand the file's node to reveal the subnodes
            for each revision and branch.</li>
            <li>Right-click the revision you want to merge into your working copy and choose
                Merge With Revision.
                <p>The IDE incorporates any differences found in the revision into your local
                copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's status is updated
                to Merge Conflict to indicate this. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To merge the difference between two revisions with your working copy:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Versioning window, expand the file's node to reveal the subnodes
            for each revision and branch.</li>
            <li>Control-click the two revision nodes whose changes you want to merge into
            your working copy.
            <li>Right-click either of the revisions and choose Merge With Rev. Differences.
            <p>The IDE incorporates any differences in the revisions into your local
            copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's VCS status changes
            to Merge Conflict to indicate this. </p>
        </ol>
