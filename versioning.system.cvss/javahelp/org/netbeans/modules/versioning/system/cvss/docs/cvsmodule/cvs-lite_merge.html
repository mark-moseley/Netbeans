        <p>The Merge command is useful for incorporating changes made on different 
            branches of the repository with your local working copy of a file or 
            directory. Any changes you make on one branch can be merged to another
            branch, including back to the trunk. You can also merge the difference
            between two earlier revisions with your local working copy.</p>
            
        <h4>To merge a file from a branch with your local working copy:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, Favorites, or 
                <a href="csh/cvs-lite_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a> window, 
                select the files or folders that you want to merge into your local
                working copy and choose CVS &gt; Merge Changes from Branch.</li>
            <li>In the dialog that appears, select the branch you want to merge
                the changes from. If you want to merge changes from a branch other 
                than the trunk, enter the branch name or click Browse to see a list 
                of available branches.</li>       
            <li>If you want to merge changes after a specific tag, select the Merge 
                Only Changes Made after Tag checkbox and designate the tag in the
                Tag Name field. Alternately, you can click the Browse buttons to 
                choose from a list of available tags.</li>
            <li>If you want to tag the merge, select the Tag Trunk after Merge (or 
                Tag <tt>branch_name</tt> after Merge) checkbox and enter the desired 
                tag name. Alternately, you can click the Browse buttons to choose 
                from a list of available tags.</li>
            <li>Click Merge. The IDE incorporates any differences found in the branch 
                version into your local copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, 
                the file's status is updated to Merge Conflict to indicate this.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>After merging file changes from a branch to your local working directory, 
                you must still commit the changes using the Commit command in order 
                for them to added to the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!--<p><b>To merge the difference between two revisions with your working copy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Versioning window, expand the file's node to reveal the subnodes
            for each revision and branch.</li>
            <li>Control-click the two revision nodes whose changes you want to merge into
            your working copy.
            <li>Right-click either of the revisions and choose Merge With Rev. Differences.
            <p>The IDE incorporates any differences in the revisions into your local
            copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's VCS status changes
            to Merge Conflict to indicate this. </p>
        </ol>--><!--todo : add info about merge from trunk (see dialog)-->
