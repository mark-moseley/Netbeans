<h2>Merging File Revisions from a Branch
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Merge command is useful for incorporating changes made on
different branches of the repository with your local working copy of a
file or directory. Any changes you make on one branch can be merged to
another
branch, including back to the trunk. You can also merge the difference
between two earlier revisions with your local working copy.</p>
<h4><b>To merge a file from a branch</b> with your local working copy:<!--<h4>To merge the difference between two revisions with your working copy:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Versioning window, expand the file's node to reveal the subnodes
            for each revision and branch.</li>
            <li>Control-click the two revision nodes whose changes you want to merge into
            your working copy.
            <li>Right-click either of the revisions and choose Merge With Rev. Differences.
            <p>The IDE incorporates any differences in the revisions into your local
            copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's VCS status changes
            to Merge Conflict to indicate this. </p>
        </ol>--><!--todo : add info about merge from trunk (see dialog)-->
</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In the Projects, Files, Favorites, or Versioning window,
right-click the files or folders that you want to merge into your local
working copy and choose CVS &gt; Branches &gt; Merge Changes from
Branch. </li>
  <li>In the dialog that appears, select the branch you want to merge
the changes to. If you want to merge changes to a branch other than the
trunk, enter the branch name or click Browse to see a list of available
branches. </li>
  <li>If you want to merge changes after a specific tag, select the
Merge Only Changes Made after Tag checkbox and designate the tag in the
Tag Name field. Alternately,
you can click the Browse buttons to choose from a list of available
tags.</li>
  <li>If you want to tag the merge, select the Tag Trunk after Merge
checkbox and enter the desired tag name. Alternately,
you can click the Browse buttons to choose from a list of available
tags.</li>
  <li>Click Merge.
    <p>The IDE incorporates any differences found in the branch version
into
your local copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's
status is updated to Merge Conflict to indicate this.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
  <li>After merging file changes from a branch to your local working
directory, you must still commit the changes using the Commit command
in order for them to added to the repository.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
