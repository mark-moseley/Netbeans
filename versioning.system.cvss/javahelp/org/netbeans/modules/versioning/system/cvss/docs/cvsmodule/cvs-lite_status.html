        <p>The IDE's CVS support enables you to view and manage the evolution
        of changes in version-controlled files.</p>
        
        <h3>Viewing Revision Information<a name="viewing"></a></h3>
        <p>The IDE's CVS support enables you to view version status information in 
        many of the IDE's windows, including the Versioning, Projects, Files, 
        and Favorites windows. The Versioning window, however, represents the primary place within
        which to manage version-controlled files by displaying a real-time list of all of the
        new, modified, removed, and out-of-date files in the currently selected project or directory. </li>
        <p>The IDE's CVS support provides file status information in the following
        ways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Status Labels. </b>Textual indication of file status 
            in the Versioning, Projects, Files, and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><b>Status color. </b>Graphical indication of file status in the 
            Versioning, Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. </li>
            <li><b>Status badges. </b> Graphical indication of the status of files
            contained within your project, folder, and package nodes. Displayed in the 
            Projects, Files, and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><b>Revision Annotations.</b> Displays commit message, author,
            date, and revision number information in the left margin of files open
            in the editor window. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The IDE displays version-controlled files using the following
            color coding and font styles:
            <table summary="The left column lists the task name. The right column lists the steps to perform."
                border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

                            to the package itself and not its subpackages. For folders, the badge
                            indicates local modifications in that folder or any of its subfolders.</p>

        <!--<h3>Tracking Changes in the Versioning Window <a name="monitor"></a></h3>
        <p>The Versioning window presents a real-time view of the changes in
        selected directories. It opens at the bottom of the IDE whenever you
        view changes made in version-controlled files. By default, the
        Versioning window displays a list of all modified files within the
        selected package or folder. 
        <p>Using the filter buttons in the toolbar,
        you can limit the list of displayed files to either locally or remotely
        modified files. The Versioning window toolbar also includes buttons
        that enable you to invoke the most common CVS tasks on all files
        displayed in the list. </p>
        <p>The following common CVS commands are available in the Versioning window's toolbar: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Refresh Status.</b></li>
            <li><b>Diff All.</b></li>
            <li><b>Update All.</b></li>
            <li><strong>Commit All.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To open the Versioning window, choose CVS &gt; Show
        All Changes. Alternately, you can right-click any project, directory,
        or file that is in a CVS working directory and choose CVS &gt; Show
        Changes.</p>-->
