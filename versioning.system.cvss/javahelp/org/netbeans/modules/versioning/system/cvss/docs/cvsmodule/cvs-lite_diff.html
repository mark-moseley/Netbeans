        <p>The Diff command compares different revisions of a file and displays the
            differences found graphically.</p>
            
        <h3>Comparing File Revisions Graphically</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE's graphical Diff Viewer enables you to compare different versions 
            of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences 
            between the files being compared.</p>
            
        <p>The previous (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="last difference button">) 
            and next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">) 
            difference buttons in the toolbar enable you to navigate among the differences 
            in the file. You can also refresh the status and update files from within
            the Diff Viewer using the Refresh Diff (<img src="images/refresh.png"
            alt="Last difference button">) and Update (<img src="images/update.png" 
            alt="Last difference button">) buttons. When you are finished comparing 
            the files, you can commit your changes using the Diff Viewer's Commit button
            (<img src="images/commit.png" alt="Last difference button">).</p>
        
        <p>The Diff Viewer highlights differences between file versions using the following colors:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue</strong> 
                ( <span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ).
                Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier revision</li>
            <li><strong>Green</strong> 
                ( <span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ).
                Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier revision</li>
            <li><strong>Red</strong> 
                ( <span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ).
                Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier revision</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>To generate a graphical diff comparing a revision to your working copy:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Select the appropriate file node in the Projects, Files,
                or Versioning window.</li>
            <li>Choose Diff (or CVS &gt; Diff) from the right-click menu. The IDE 
                displays the results in the Diff Viewer in a new tab of the main 
                window.</li>
        </ol>
