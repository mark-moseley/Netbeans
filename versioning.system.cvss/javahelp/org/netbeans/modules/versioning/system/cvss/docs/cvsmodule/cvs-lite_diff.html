    <h2>Comparing File Revisions</h2>
	         
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>The Diff command compares different versions of a file and displays the differences
    found graphically or as text.</p>
	 <a name="graphically"></a>
    <h3>Comparing File Revisions Graphically</h3>
    <p>The IDE's Graphical Diff Viewer enables you to compare different versions
    	of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences
    	between the files being compared. The previous (<img src="images/prev.gif" alt="Last difference button">)
    and next (<img src="images/next.gif" alt="Next difference button">) difference
    buttons in the toolbar enable you to navigate among the differences in the
    file. You can also refresh the status and update files from within the Diff
    Viewer using the Refresh Diff and Update buttons. When you are finished comparing
    the files, you can commit your changes using the Graphical Diff
    Viewer's Commit button. </p>
    <p>The Graphical Diff Viewer's  highlights changes in the files using the
    	following colors: </p>
	<ul>
    <li><strong>Blue</strong>. Lines that have been changed.</li>
    <li> <strong>Green</strong>. Lines that have been added since
    	the earlier revision. </li>
    <li><strong>Red</strong>. Lines that have been removed.</li>
	</ul>
    <p><b>To generate a graphical diff comparing a revision to your working copy:</b>

<ol>
            <li>Right-click the appropriate revision node in the Projects, Files,
            	or Versioning window.
            <li>Choose Diff  from the pop-up menu.
</ol>

        <!--<p><b>To generate a graphical diff comparing two revisions:</b>
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Control-click to select the revision nodes you want to compare
            	in the Projects, Files, or Versioning
            window.
            <li>Right-click either of their nodes and choose Diff.
        </ol>-->
        <p>The results are displayed in the Graphical Diff Viewer in a new tab
     	  of the main window. </p>
    </ul>
    <!--<h3>Comparing File Revisions as Text<a name="textually"></a></h3>
    <p>You can also use the Diff Textual command to view file revision differences.
    To view the differences between your working copy with the repository's current
    version, right-click the node of the file you want to compare and choose CVS > Diff
    Textual. The results are displayed in the IDE's Output window.</p>
    <ul class="note">
    <li>To enter specific revisions, tags, or dates to
    for the versions compared, press the Control key while choosing Diff commands.</li></ul>-->
