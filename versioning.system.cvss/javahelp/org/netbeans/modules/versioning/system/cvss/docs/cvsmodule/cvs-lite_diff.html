    <p>The Diff command compares different versions of a file and displays the differences
    found graphically or as text.</p>
    <h3>Comparing File Revisions Graphically<a name="graphically"></a></h3>
    <p>The IDE's Graphical Diff Viewer allows you to view different versions of a
    file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences between files
    being compared. The previous (<img src="images/prev.gif" alt="Last difference button">)
    and next (<img src="images/next.gif" alt="Next difference button">) difference
    buttons allow you to navigate among the differences in the file.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>To generate a graphical diff comparing a revision to your working copy:</b>
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the appropriate revision node in the Versioning window.
            <li>Choose Diff Graphical from the contextual menu.
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>To generate a graphical diff comparing two revisions:</b>
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>Control-click the revision nodes you want to compare in the Versioning
            window.
            <li>Right-click either of their nodes and choose Diff Graphical.
        </ol>
        <p>The results are displayed in the Graphical Diff Viewer in a new tab of the
        main window. Changed lines are highlighted in blue and lines that have been
        added since the earlier revision are highlighted in green. Lines that have
        been removed are highlighted in red.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Comparing File Revisions as Text<a name="textually"></a></h3>
    <p>You can also use the Diff Textual command to view file revision differences.
    To view the differences between your working copy with the repository's current
    version, right-click the node of the file you want to compare and choose CVS > Diff
    Textual. The results are displayed in the IDE's Output window.</p>
    <ul class="note">
    <li>To enter specific revisions, tags, or dates to
    for the versions compared, press the Control key while choosing Diff commands.</li></ul>
