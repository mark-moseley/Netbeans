        <p>The Diff command compares different revisions of a file and displays
        the differences found graphically.</p>
        <h3>Comparing File Revisions Graphically</h3>
        <p>The IDE's Graphical Diff Viewer enables you to compare different
            versions of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the
            differences between the files being compared.</p>
        <p>The previous (<img src="images/diff-prev.png"
        alt="Last difference button" height="16" width="16">) and next (<img
        src="images/diff-next.png" alt="Next difference button" height="16"
        width="16">) difference
        buttons in the toolbar enable you to navigate among the differences in
        the file. You can also refresh the status and update files from within
        the Diff Viewer using the Refresh Diff (<img src="images/refresh.png"
        alt="Last difference button" height="16" width="16">) and Update (<img
        src="images/update.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16"
        width="16">) buttons. When you are finished comparing the files, you
        can commit your changes using the Graphical Diff Viewer's Commit button
        (<img src="images/commit.png" alt="Last difference button" height="16"
        width="16">). </p>
        <p>The Graphical Diff Viewer's highlights changes in the files using
        the following colors: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue</strong>. Indicates lines that have been changed
            since the earlier revision.</li>
            <li> <strong>Green</strong>. Indicates lines that have been added
            since the earlier revision. </li>
            <li><strong>Red</strong>. Indicates lines that have been removed
            since the earlier revision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To generate a graphical diff comparing a revision to your working
            copy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the appropriate file node in the Projects, Files,
            or Versioning window. </li>
            <li>Choose Diff from the pop-up menu. </li>
        </ol>
        <!--<p><b>To generate a graphical diff comparing two revisions:</b>
        </li>
        <ol>
        <li>Control-click to select the revision nodes you want to compare
        in the Projects, Files, or Versioning
        window.
        <li>Right-click either of their nodes and choose Diff.
        </ol>-->
        <p>The IDE displays the results in the Graphical Diff Viewer in a new
           tab of the main window.
           <!--mention the search window diffs here also--></p>
        <!--<h3>Comparing File Revisions as Text<a name="textually"></a></h3>
        <p>You can also use the Diff Textual command to view file revision differences.
        To view the differences between your working copy with the repository's current
        version, right-click the node of the file you want to compare and choose CVS > Diff
        Textual. The results are displayed in the IDE's Output window.</p>
        <ul class="note">
        <li>To enter specific revisions, tags, or dates to
        for the versions compared, press the Control key while choosing Diff commands.</li></ul>-->
