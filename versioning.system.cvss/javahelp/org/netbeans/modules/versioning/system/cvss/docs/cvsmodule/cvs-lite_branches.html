        <h2>Working with Branches</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Using the IDE's CVS support  you can work with branches that
	 enable you to maintain different versions of an entire code base. A branch
	is created by attaching a branch tag to a file or folder in the repository.
	When you  modify files in a branch it does not affect
	the files in the main code line (also known as the "trunk").
You can, however,  merge any modifications in the branch back into the trunk
	later.</p>
<h3>Checking out Branches</h3>
<p>Once a branch is created, you can check out the branch to copy the files to
	your local working directory.</p>
<ul class="note">
	<li>You must create a new local working directory within which to checkout
	the branch. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>To check out a branch to a local working directory:</b></p>
<ol><li>Choose CVS &gt; Checkout from the main menu.</li>
  	<li>On the first page of the CVS Checkout wizard, specify the  location
  		of the CVS repository by
  		choosing from the CVS Root drop-down menu. If you are unfamiliar with the
  		syntax, click the Edit button and enter the required information for the
  		local CVS working directory you wish to use.</li>
  	<li>Enter your password in the Password field and click Next. 
	<li>If you are using a proxy, click the Proxy Configuration button and enter
		the required information. Click Next. <!--Note that by default the IDE sets this
	to Use System Proxy Settings.	-->
	<li>On the Module to Checkout page,  specify the files and directories
            	you want to check out in the Module field or click the Browse
     	button to choose from a list of all modules in the repository. </li>
  	<li>Specify the  branch, revision number, or tag for
  		the checkout in the Branch field or click the Browse
	button to choose from a list of all branches in the repository.</li>
  	<li>Specify the local working directory into which you want to check out the
  		selected modules or branches. Alternately, you can click the Browse button
	to navigate to the desired directory on your system.</li>
  	<li>Click Finish to check out the files.</li>
  	<p>The IDE initiates the Checkout command for the branch. The IDE's Status
  		bar  indicates the  progress of the files downloading from the branch
  		to your local working directory.</p>
</ol>


<h3>Working in a Branch</h3>
<p>When you are working in a branch, any changes you make are made in the branch
	and do effect the trunk. To merge files back to the trunk or another branch,
	you can use the Update command, specifying the revision tags in the advanced
	options.</p>

<p><b>To merge files from a branch:</b></p><!--todo : add info about merge from trunk (see dialog)-->
<ol>
	<li>In the Projects, Files, or Versioning window,  right-click the files or
		folders you want to merge to the trunk (or a different branch) and choose
		CVS &gt; Merge
	Changes from Branch. </li>
	<li>In the CVS Update dialog box, select <b>Merge from Branch.</b> </li>
	<li>Specify the branch, revision number, or tag for the checkout in the Merge
		from Branch field or click the Browse button to choose from a list of all
		branches in the repository.</li>
	<li>Select any options you require and click Merge.
		<p>When you click OK, the files from your branch directory are merged into
			your local working directory. Merge conflicts are indicated in the Versioning
			window by the Merge Conflict badge ( <img src="images/badgeMergeConflict.gif" alt="Note"> ).</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="cvs-lite_mergeresolve.html">Resolve any merge conflicts</a> in your local working directory resulting from the merge.</li>
	<li>Right-click the files or folders to commit and choose CVS &gt; Commit.</li>
	<li>Click OK to <a href="cvs-lite_commit.html">commit your local files to the repository</a>.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Creating a branch</h3>
<p>Branches are created by adding a branch tag to a file revision or directory.</p>

<p><b>To create a branch:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>In the Projects, Files, or Versioning window, right-click the file or folder
	you want to be the root of your branch and choose CVS &gt; Branch.</li>
	<li>In the Branch dialog, enter a Branch name,   Tag name, and set any desired
		options.</li>
	<li>Click Branch.</li>
	<p>The IDE  adds a branch tag to the selected file or directory and creates
		the branch.</p>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
	<li>When you add a branch tag, the branch is immediately created in the repository without requiring the Commit command.</li>
</ul>
