        <h2>Committing Local Changes to a Remote Repository</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been edited,
     	  you can then place your changes into the repository using the Commit
        	command. </p>
			<!--todo : mention adding and removing-->
        <ul class="note">
        <li>Project directories must be located within a 
        local working directory that is registered with the IDE
        in order to call CVS commands on them.</li></ul>
        <h4>To commit changes in local files to a remote repository:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to commit in the Versioning window,
            Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window.
            <li>Ensure that your local copies of the files are up-to-date by right-clicking
            and choosing CVS > Update before committing your changes.
            <li>Right-click the files or directories you wish to commit and choose CVS > Commit.
            Note that if the files you want to commit do not already exist in the repository,
            the Commit command will add them.</li>
            <p>The CVS Commit dialog box appears prompting you to enter a message describing
            your changes.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>Ignoring Files</h3>
            <p>The IDE enables you to determine which files within your working directory 
               are committed to the remote repository when calling CVS commands. Using the 
               Ignore command, you can tell the IDE to ignore those files and directories you 
               do not want to place under version control.
        <h4>To ignore local files in your working directory:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to ignore in the Versioning window,
            Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window.
            <li>Right-click the files or directories you wish to ignore and choose CVS > Ignore.
            Note that the Ignore command is unavailable for files that already exist in the repository.</li>
            <p>The IDE ignores the file or directory whenever CVS commands are called on
                them or the directories within which they are stored.</p>
        </ol>
