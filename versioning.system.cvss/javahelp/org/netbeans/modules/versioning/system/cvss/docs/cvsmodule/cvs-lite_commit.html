        <h2>Committing Local Changes to a Remote Repository</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been edited, you 
            can then place your changes into the repository using the Commit command.</p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Project directories must be located within a local working directory 
                that is registered with the IDE in order to call CVS commands on them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To commit changes in local files to a remote repository:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <a href="csh/cvs-lite_versioning_window.html">Versioning window</a>, 
                confirm that you want to commit the listed files.</li>
            <li>Ensure that your local copies of the files are up-to-date by clicking the 
                Update All (<img src="images/update.png" alt="update all icon">) button 
                prior to committing your changes.</li>
            <li>Once the Update command has finished, commit the files by clicking the 
                Commit All (<img src="images/commit.png" alt="commit all icon">) button. 
                If the files you want to commit do not already exist in the repository, 
                the Commit command will add them.</li>
            <li>Enter a message describing your changes in the CVS Commit dialog that 
                appears and click Commit. The IDE executes the Commit command and the
                selected files are committed to the repository.
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the Recent Messages icon (<img src="images/recent_msgs.png" 
                        alt="recent messages icon">) in the upper right corner of the 
                        dialog to view recent commit messages.</li>
<!--                <li>Click the Load Template icon (<img src="images/load_template.png"
                        alt="load templates icon">) in the upper right corner of the 
                        dialog to load text from Template file directly into the Commit
                        Message text area.</li>   -->
                </ul></li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can also commit files or directories from the Projects window, Files 
                window, or Favorites window by right-clicking the files or directories 
                you wish to commit and choosing CVS &gt; Commit.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Excluding Files from a Commit</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE enables you to specify which files in your local working directory 
            are recognized when using CVS commands. Using the Exclude from Commit 
            command, you can set the IDE to temporarily disregard files when making 
            commits.</p>
            
        <h4>To exclude local files in your working directory:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to ignore in the Versioning 
                window, Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window.</li>
            <li>Right-click and select the CVS &gt; Exclude from Commit option. If 
                you have the <a href="csh/cvs-lite_versioning_window.html">Versioning 
                window</a> opened, note that the IDE displays the file or directory 
                name in strike-through text and disregards the item(s) whenever the 
                commit command is called. Note that the files remain excluded until 
                you include them.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>To remove the exclude status from a file or directory, right-click the
                selected file or directory, choose CVS and deselect the Exclude from 
                Commit option.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ignoring Files</h3>
        
        <p>If your local working directory includes files or directories that you 
            do not want to place under version control, you can set the IDE to 
            ignore them permanently using the Ignore command.</p>
            
        <h4>To ignore local files in your working directory:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to ignore in the Versioning
                window, Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window.</li>
            <li>Right-click and choose CVS &gt; Ignore. Note that the Ignore command 
                is unavailable for files that already exist in the repository. The 
                IDE ignores the file or directory whenever CVS commands are called 
                on them or the directories within which they are stored.</li>
