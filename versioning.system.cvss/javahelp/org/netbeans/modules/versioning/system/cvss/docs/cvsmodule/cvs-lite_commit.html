        <h2>Committing Local Changes to a Remote Repository</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been
        edited, you can then place your changes into the repository using the
        Commit command. </p>
        <!--todo : mention adding and removing-->
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Project directories must be located within a local working
            directory that is registered with the IDE in order to call CVS commands
            on them.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>To commit changes in local files to a remote repository:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Versioning window, confirm that you want to commit the listed files. </li>
            <li>Ensure that your local copies of the files are up-to-date by
            clicking the Update All button prior to committing your
            changes. </li>
            <li>Once the Update command has finished, commit the files by 
            clicking the Commit All button. If the files you want to commit do not already
            exist in the repository, the Commit command will add them.</li>
            <li>Enter a message describing your changes in the CVS Commit dialog 
            that appears.
            <li>Click Commit.</li>
            <p>The IDE executes the Commit command.</p>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can also commit files or directories from the Projects window, 
            Files window, or Favorites window by right-clicking the files or directories 
            you wish to commit and choose CVS &gt; Commit.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Excluding Files from a Commit</h3>
        <p>The IDE enables you to specify which files in your local working
        directory are recognized when using CVS commands. Using the Exclude from Commit 
        command, you can set the IDE to temporarily disregard files when making commits.</p>
        <h4>To exclude local files in your working directory:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to ignore in the
            Versioning window, Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window. </li>
            <li>Right-click and choose CVS &gt; Exclude from Commit. Note that the 
            command is unavailable for files that already exist in the repository.</li>
            <p>The IDE displays the file or directory name in strikethrough text in  
            the Versioning window and disregards the items whenever the Commit command is
            is called. Note that the files remain excluded until you include them.</p>
        </ol>        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>To remove the exclude status from a file or directory, right-click the
            and choose CVS > Include in Commit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ignoring Files</h3>
        <p>If your local working directory includes files or directories that you 
        do not want to place under version control, you can set the IDE to 
        ignore them permanantly using the Ignore command. </p>
        <h4>To ignore local files in your working directory:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to ignore in the
            Versioning window, Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window. </li>
            <li>Right-click and choose CVS &gt; Ignore. Note that the Ignore
            command is unavailable for files that already exist in the repository.</li>
            <p>The IDE ignores the file or directory whenever CVS commands are
            called on them or the directories within which they are stored.</p>
