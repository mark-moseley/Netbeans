        <p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been edited, you
        can place your changes into the repository. The procedure varies depending
        on which VCS client you are using.</p>
        <ul class="note">
        <li>Project directories must be located within a 
        local working directory that is registered with the Versioning Manager
        in order to call VCS commands on them.</li></ul>
        <h4>To commit files to a VCS repository using the IDE's built-in CVS client:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to commit in the Versioning window,
            Files window,
            or Favorites window.
            <li>Ensure that your local copies of the files are up-to-date by right-clicking
            and choosing CVS > Update
            before committing your changes.
            <li>If the files you want to commit do not already exist in the repository,
            add them first by right-clicking and choosing CVS > Add.</li>
            <li>Right-click the files or directories you wish to commit and choose CVS > Commit.</li>
            <p>The CVS Commit dialog box appears prompting you to enter a message describing
            your changes.</p>
            <li>If you want to set additional options, specify them using the checkboxes
            below the Enter Reason field. You can specify the following arguments:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Force to Commit.</b>&nbsp; Forces a local commit even if you have not
                changed the files in your local directory.</li>
                <li><b>Commit to Branch or Revision.</b>&nbsp; Commits to a branch or revision
                on the trunk that is higher than the existing revision. Type the revision
                or branch in the text box.</li>
                <li><b>Run the Module Program (if any).</b>&nbsp; Invokes the <tt>-n</tt> option
                and does not run any checkout, commit, or tag programs.
                <p><b>Note:</b> the  Commit dialog box also includes
                a <a href="">Common
                Options tab</a> in which you can set global CVS command options. </li>
            </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
        <li>If you do not see all of these options, your CVS
        filesystem is not set to display advanced command options. To set the filesystem's
        Advanced Options property to True, open the Versioning Manager, click Edit,
        and select Advanced Mode in the Advanced tab. You can also hold down the
        Control key while choosing the Commit command.</li></ul>
