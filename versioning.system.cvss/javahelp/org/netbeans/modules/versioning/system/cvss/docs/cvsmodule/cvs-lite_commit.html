<h2>Committing Local Changes to a Remote Repository</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been
edited, you can then place your changes into the repository using the
Commit command. </p>
<!--todo : mention adding and removing-->
<ul class="note">
  <li>Project directories must be located within a local working
directory that is registered with the IDE in order to call CVS commands
on them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>To commit changes in local files to a remote repository:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Select the files or directories you wish to commit in the
Versioning window, Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window. </li>
  <li>Ensure that your local copies of the files are up-to-date by
right-clicking and choosing CVS &gt; Update before committing your
changes. </li>
  <li>Right-click the files or directories you wish to commit and
choose CVS &gt; Commit. If the files you want to commit do not already
exist in the repository, the Commit command will add them.</li>
  <p>The CVS Commit dialog appears prompting you to enter a message
describing your changes.</p>
</ol>
<h3>Ignoring Files</h3>
<p>The IDE enables you to specify which files in your local working
directory are recognized when using CVS commands. Using the Ignore
command, you can set the IDE to ignore the files and directories you do
not want to place under version control. </p>
<h4>To ignore local files in your working directory:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Select the files or directories you wish to ignore in the
Versioning window, Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window. </li>
  <li>Right-click and choose CVS &gt; Ignore. Note that the Ignore
command is unavailable for files that already exist in the repository.</li>
  <p>The IDE ignores the file or directory whenever CVS commands are
called on them or the directories within which they are stored.</p>
</ol>
