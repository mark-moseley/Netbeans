            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

<!-- Question: compat-standards

     <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
The module uses <a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/package-summary.html">Swing text package</a>.
It extends it in <a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/NbDocument.html">NbDocument</a> class which adds
support for:
<ul>
<li><a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/NbDocument.WriteLockable.html">locking document for complex modifications</a></li>

<!-- Question: compat-version

     <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
Module uses serialization. It coexists with the earlier versions, but 
not with future ones. The future versions will be able to read settings.

            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">

            of any of your components?
            
            <hint>
            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-component">
The module can be influencend by this property:
<api type="export" group="property" name="indentEngine" category="stable" >
Property hold instance of <a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/IndentEngine.html">IndentEngine</a>
and this indentation engine is used instead of system one.
</api>

It set these Swing properties:
<api type="import" group="property" name="javax.swing.text.Document.StreamDescriptionProperty" category="stable" >
Property hold instance of <a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html">DataObject</a>
from which the document was created. This property can be used by the modules and is part of the Editor API.
</api>

<api type="import" group="property" name="javax.swing.text.Document.TitleProperty" category="stable" >
Property hold instance of String with name of the file being edited.
This property can be used by the modules and is part of the Editor API.
</api>

<api type="export" group="property" name="javax.swing.text.Document.modificationListener" category="friend" >
In order to fix <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=51872">issue 51872</a> the 
openide needs a way how to be notified about change of a document outside of its Document lock. 
<code>DocumentListener</code>s are always notified under the lock, so a special contract has
been established (since version 5.3) by registering an instance of <code>VetoableListener</code>
by calling <code>putProperty ("modificationListener", listener)</code>. The
NetBeans aware documents are adviced to honor this property and call the listener
outside of the document lock when a modification is made. The actual contract
of the call can be seen in 
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/source/browse/openide/test/unit/src/org/openide/text/NbLikeEditorKit.java">NbLikeEditorKit.java</a> 
in methods 
<code>insertString</code> and <code>remove</code>.

            If there is a property that can change the behaviour of your 
            code, somebody will likely use it. You should describe what it does 
            and the stability category of this API. You may use
            <PRE>

     <question id="exec-reflection">
            Does your code uses java.lang.reflect to execute some other code?
            <hint>
            This usually indicates a missing or unsufficient API in the other
            part of the system. If the other side is not aware of your dependency
            this contract can be easily broken.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="exec-reflection">
Yes, it calls protected method <a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/MultiDataObject.html#getCookieSet()">MultiDataObject.getCookieSet()</a>.
The class which calls this is deprecated, but it is still in use by clients.
<p/>
Another reflection is used in QuietEditorPane, where DelegatingTransferHandler delegates
also on two protected methods of TransferHandler: <code>createTransferable</code> and 
<code>exportDone</code>. This delegation is needed because of drag and drop feature described
in  <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=53439">issue #53439</a>

<!-- Question: resources-layer

     <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

<!-- Question: resources-mask

     <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? 
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

<!-- Question: resources-read

     <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
            
            <hint>
            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.
            Please describe it and clasify according to 
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/tutorial/api-design.html#categories">
            common stability categories</a>.

        <question id="exec-introspection">
            Does your module use any kind of runtime type informations (instanceof,
            work with java.lang.Class, etc.)?
            <hint>
            Check for cases when you have an object of type A and you also
            expect it to (possibly) be of type B and do some special action. That
            should be documented. The same applies on operations in meta-level
            (Class.isInstance(...), Class.isAssignableFrom(...), etc.).

<answer id="exec-introspection">
The Editor module operate with plain Swing <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/javax/swing/text/Document.html">Document</a> in 
its APIs and checks whether the document does not implement some of the Netbeans extensions defined in
<a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/NbDocument.html">NbDocument</a>.
It also tries to retype <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/CloneableTopComponent.Ref.html#getComponents()">CloneableTopComponent.Ref.getComponents()</a>
to its <a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/CloneableEditor.html">CloneableEditor</a>. If some document does not implement 
<a href="@JDK@/javax/swing/text/StyledDocument.html">StyledDocument</a>,
it is wrapped into <a href="@org-openide-text@/org/openide/text/FilterDocument.html">FilterDocument</a> which implements limited StyledDocument functionality.

        <question id="exec-process">
            Do you execute an external process from your module? How do you ensure
            that the result is the same on different platforms? Do you parse output?
            Do you depend on result code?
            <hint>
            If you feed an input, parse the output please declare that as an API.
