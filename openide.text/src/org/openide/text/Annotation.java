/** Description of annotation. The class is extended by modules
 * which creates annotations and defines annotation type and tooltip.
 * The annotation can be attached to Annotatable object. Editors which
 * displays Annotations listen on PropertyChangeListner for changes of
 * annotation type or tooltip text. The tooltip text can be evaluated
 * asynchronously. It means that editors after the getShortDescription call
 * must listen on PropertyChangeListner while the tooltip is visible.
 * If the tooltip text property is changed, the tooltip value must be updated.
