NetBeans is able to integrate multiple

<a href="http://top/org/openide/text/doc-files/api.html"><em>editors</em></a>

for different content types and mechanically access their content.

<p>

Using the <a href="doc-files/api.html"><b>Editor API</b></a>, it is
possible to get access to the Swing-based editor which is being used
to edit an open file of whatever content type. This would permit you
to test what the user was doing with this file; mechanically retrieve
and modify text from the open buffer; prevent certain areas of a
textual file from being modified by the user; set annotations in the
gutter; and so on.

<p>

This API also permits a module implementor to add a custom editor for
some or all (probably textual) content types. Essentially, any editor
implementation may be used which is capable of being embedded as a
Swing EditorKit; handling guarded blocks; and handling breakpoints and
the like (for Java source).
