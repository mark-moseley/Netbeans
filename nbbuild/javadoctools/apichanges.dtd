One API change. Giving an ID is recommended as it permits external hyperlinking
to the generated document (the ID will be used as an HTML anchor) - but if you
have one (and only one) associated issue, that will be used as a default stable
ID (format "issue-NNNNN"), or the version number will also be used as a default
stable ID (format "version-N.NN"). Giving the date is technically optional but
should be done for all new changes.
