<p>Adds to the functionality in <b>Leaf&nbsp;Node</b> by providing
a list of child nodes, in this case using the common and versatile <code>Children.Keys</code>.
It adds support for adding new subnodes, handling pastes of various types of data and converting
them, and reordering child nodes.</p>

<p>The children class (separate) shows how you can lazily determine
what the children should be (only when the parent is expanded), including garbage collecting them
after a period of disuse; create nodes corresponding to various abstract keys which represent them;
and manipulate the key set in various ways, usually in cooperation with the parent node. The icon
set for the parent may provide a different appearance when the node is expanded.</p>

<p>The default executor lets you see a test sample of the node inside the IDE.</p>
