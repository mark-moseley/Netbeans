    <category id="dep" name="Project and platform dependencies">
        <question id="dep-nb">
            What other NetBeans projects this one depends on?
        </question>
        
        <question id="dep-non-nb">
            What other non-NetBeans projects this one depends on?
            
            <hint>
            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may
            depend on such third-party library.
            </hint>
        </question>
        
        <question id="dep-platform">
            On which platforms your module run? Any? Does it run in the same
            way?
        </question>
        
        <question id="dep-jre">
            Which version of JRE you need (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc.)?
        </question>

        <question id="dep-jrejdk">
            Do you require JDK or is JRE enough?
        </question>
                
    </category>

    <category id="deploy" name="Deployment">
        <question id="deploy-jar">
            Do you deploy just module JAR file(s) or some other files?
        </question>
    
        <question id="deploy-nbm">
            Can you deploy NBM via AutoUpdate center?
        </question>
        
        <question id="deploy-shared">
            Do you need to be installed in shared location or only in user directory?
        </question>
        
        
        <question id="deploy-packages">
            Are packages of your module made inaccessible by not declaring them
            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used
            whenever possible (<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/doc-files/upgrade.html#3.4-public-packages">
            public packages
            </a>). 
            </hint>
        </question>
        
        
    </category>
    
    <category id="compat" name="Compatiblity with environment">
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
        </question>
        <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
        <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>

    <category id="resources" name="Access to resources">
        <question id="resources-file">
            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.
            </hint>
        </question>
        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.). 
            </hint>
        </question>
        
        <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module read any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? Why?
        </question>
        
        <question id="resources-read">
            Does your module read any resources from layers? For what purpose?
        </question>
    </category>

    
    <category id="lookup" name="Lookup of components">
        <question id="lookup-lookup">
            Does your module used <code>org.openide.util.Lookup</code>
            to find any components to communicate to? Which ones?
        </question>
        <question id="lookup-register">
            Do you register anything into the lookup for other to find? Who are 
            the others?
        </question>
        <question id="lookup-remove">
            Are removing entries of other modules from the lookup? Why?
        </question>

        </question>
        
        <question id="exec-component">

        <question id="perf-scale">
            Which external criteria influence the performance of your

            in source directory, etc.) and how well your code scales?
            Please include some estimates.
        </question>
        <question id="perf-limit">
            Are there any limits in number/size of elements your code
            can handle?
        </question>
        <!-- multithreading -->
    
        <question id="perf-mem">
            What is the amount of memory your component occupies? Estimate

        </question>

        <question id="perf-progress">
            Does your module executes some long running task?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.
            </hint>
        </question>

        <question id="perf-huge_dialogs">
            Does your module contain any dialogs or wizards with huge

            areas?
        </question>

        <question id="perf-menus">
            Does your module use dynamically changing context menus or
            context sensitive actions with complicated logic for enable/disable?
