INFO FOR PEOPLE ADDING CHANGES:

Check the DTD (apichanges.dtd) for details on the syntax. You do not
need to regenerate the HTML, as this is part of Javadoc generation; just
change the XML. Rough syntax of a change (several parts optional):

<change>
    <api name="compiler"/>
    <summary>Some brief description here, can use <b>XHTML</b></summary>
    <version major="1" minor="99"/>
    <date day="13" month="6" year="2001"/>
    <author login="jrhacker"/>
    <compatibility addition="yes"/>
    <description>
        The main description of the change here.
        Again can use full <b>XHTML</b> as needed.
    </description>
    <class package="org.openide.compiler" name="DoWhatIWantCompiler"/>
    <issue number="14309"/>
</change>

Also permitted elements: <package>, <branch>. <version> is API spec
version, recommended for all new changes. <compatibility> should say
if things were added/modified/deprecated/etc. and give all information
related to upgrading old code. List affected top-level classes and
link to issue numbers if applicable. See the DTD for more details.

Changes need not be in any particular order, they are sorted in various
ways by the stylesheet anyway.

Dates are assumed to mean "on the trunk". If you *also* make the same
change on a stabilization branch, use the <branch> tag to indicate this
and explain why the change was made on a branch in the <description>.

Please only change this file on the trunk! Rather: you can change it
on branches if you want, but these changes will be ignored; only the
trunk version of this file is important.

Deprecations do not count as incompatible, assuming that code using the
deprecated calls continues to see their documented behavior. But do
specify deprecation="yes" in <compatibility>.

This file is not a replacement for Javadoc: it is intended to list changes,
not describe the complete current behavior, for which ordinary documentation
is the proper place.

                The new methods were added to allow for getting the formatting/indentation

                The new <code>CodeStylePreferences</code> class was added in order to
                unify access to editor formatting/indentation preferences (ie. code style).

                <p>
                    The API/SPI classes were moved from the official <code>org.netbeans.api</code>
                    and <code>org.netbeans.spi</code> packages and the stability level
                    of the API was set to <code>devel</code> to indicate that the module
                    and its API is still under development. The major version of the
                    module was set to <code>2</code> to mark the incompatible change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was not enough time in the Netbeans 6.0 release timeframe for us
                    to fully stabilize the APIs offered by this module. Therefore we
                    decided to release the <b>development</b> version of the APIs and
                    do a full API review in the next release cycle.
                </p>
