There are two separate api/spi sets in j2eeserver.  The devmodules
api/spi is for j2ee development modules (web, j2ee app, etc).  The
plugins api/spi is for server plugins.

<h2> devmodules
</h2>
    The spi classes are to be subclassed by dev modules and to be
    provided as cookies on the development nodes.  The api classes are
    to be used to add actions/properties/additional cookies to those
    nodes.

<h2> plugins
</h2>
    A jsr88 plugin can be installed without using the additional
    api/spi classes.  It needs to be wrapped as a module with an entry
    in the /J2EE/Jsr88Plugins/ folder in the default filesystem, so
    the server registry can pick up the plugin.  Additional
    functionality outside the deployment spec can be provided by the
    plugin through use of the api/spi classes.

<h2> test plugin
</h2>
    The j2eeserver/test directory contains the source to a sample
    plugin containing both jsr88 classes and the wrapper to install
    this into the registry.

<h2> user view and design
</h2>

<p>
Separate <a href="userview.html">user view</a> and <a href="design.html">design</a> documents are also available.
