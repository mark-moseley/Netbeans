<body>
There are two separate api/spi sets in j2eeserver. The devmodules
api/spi is for j2ee development modules (web, j2ee app, etc). The
plugins api/spi is for server plugins.
<h2> devmodules
</h2>
The spi classes are to be subclassed by dev modules and to be provided
as cookies on the development nodes. The api classes are to be used to
add actions/properties/additional cookies to those nodes.
<h2> plugins
</h2>
A jsr88 plugin can be installed without using the additional api/spi
classes. It needs to be wrapped as a module with an entry in the
/J2EE/DeploymentPlugins folder in the default filesystem, so the server
registry can pick up the plugin. Additional functionality outside the
deployment spec can be provided by the plugin through use of the
api/spi classes.&nbsp; These additional functionality neeed to be
declared through the plugin module <a
 href="http://j2eeserver.netbeans.org/plugin-layer-file.html">layer.xml</a>.
<h2> test plugin
</h2>
The j2eeserver/test directory contains the source to a sample plugin
containing both jsr88 classes and the wrapper to install this into the
registry.
<h2> user view and design
</h2>
<p>Documents are available <a href="http://j2eeserver.netbeans.org">online</a>.
