<h2>Action Wizard: Action Type</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 

<p>The New Action wizard creates a new <a href="../create_plugin/filelevel_create/about_actions.html">Action</a>.
 You open the New Action wizard by right-clicking a module project, choosing New &gt; File/Folder and selecting Action 
  from the NetBeans Plug-in Module category.
<p>In the Action Type page, you have to set the type: 
<ul>
	<li><b>Always Enabled (use CallableSystemAction).</b> Specifies that the action will be invoked
	from a menu item in the menu bar, from a toolbar button in a toolbar, or from a keyboard shortcut anywhere
	in the IDE.
	<li><b>Conditionally Enabled (use CookieAction).</b> Specifies the classes for which the action will be created.
	This is normally one of your own classes. For example, if you use the <a href="FileRecognitionPanel.html">New File wizard</a>,
	one of the generated classes is called <tt><i>something</i>DataObject</tt>. This is the name of the cookie class
	that you type in the Conditionally Enabled drop-down list. However, optionally, you can also include one or more of the
        following, which creates the action for all classes that subclass them:
	 <ul>
		 <li>DataObject</li>
		 <li>EditCookie</li>
		 <li>EditorCookie</li>
		 <li>OpenCookie</li>
		 <li>Project</li></ul>
	 <li><b>Allow Multiple Selections.</b> Specifies the conditions under which the 
	  action will be enabled. By default, the action will only be enabled when the
	  node for which it is created is selected. If you select Allow Multiple Selections, the action
	   will also be enabled when more nodes than just the node for which it is created
	    is selected.
 </ul>
