<h2>Module Project Properties Dialog Box: API Versioning</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 

<p>You open the Module Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking 
a module project and choosing Properties. 

<p>The API Versioning page contains the following:

<ul><li><b>Code Name Base:</b> Displays the name that uniquely identifies the module.
	Sets <tt>OpenIDE-Module</tt> in the <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file. This line in the <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file
	identifies the JAR file as a module, and provides its code name. If you expose APIs, the code name 
	is what other modules will use to refer to your module when they declare a dependency on it.
       	The standard convention is for the name to match the package structure of the module.	</li>
	<li><b>Major Release Version.</b> Specifies the major release version in <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt>; may be blank or a non-negative integer.
	For example, if your module is called <tt>org.myorg.module</tt>, the major release version will be
	displayed as a forward slash with a number in the <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file: <tt>org.myorg.module/1</tt>.
	This is typically useful if your module exposes some APIs; modules can declare a dependency on a specific 
	specification version of the module, so that the depending module will not be loaded if it requires 
	version 2, but the version of your module that's installed is version 1. For modules with no API to 
	expose, or which are trivial and unlikely ever to change, the major release version is not required.
	<li><b>Specification Version.</b> Sets <tt>OpenIDE-Module-Specification-Version</tt> in the <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file. Typically when 
	you add methods that are publicly available (part of the API of your module), you will increment this
	number by 0.1, so versions increment 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and so forth. Thus other modules that need to use
       	a method or class introduced in 1.1 can declare a dependency on 1.1, so they will not be loaded if that version is not present.
        <p><b>Note:</b> Increment this version whenever you wish a new version of the module to be
        pushed to users of an update center.
	<li><b>Append Implementation Versions Automatically.</b> 
	<li><b>Implementation Version.</b> Sets <tt>OpenIDE-Module-Implementation-Version</tt> in the <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file. Modules declare, 
	in their <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file, what packages they make available to other modules, in the <tt>public-packages</tt>
	section of the <tt>nbproject/project.xml</tt> file. If your module tries to use a class from another module which is public, 
	but that class is not actually in one of the packages the other module declares as its "public packages", 
	it will throw a <tt>NoClassDefFoundException</tt> at runtime.
	<li><b>Module Type.</b>
	<ul>
 		<li><b>Regular.</b> A module that is loaded when the platform starts up. 
		<li><b>Autoload.</b> A module that is loaded only when another module needs it. For example,
		 a library wrapper module is only loaded when a module that depends on it needs it.
		 <li><b>Eager.</b> A module that is loaded if all its dependencies are satisfied. For example,
		  the module that provides coloring for NetBeans files depends on the module that provides the editor.
		  Therefore, when you disable the editor module, the IDE automatically disables the coloring module.
		 
	</ul>	
	<li><b>Public Packages.</b> Displays a list of all packages contained in the 
	source directory plus any <tt>class-path-extensions</tt>. If checked, the package is included among <tt>public-packages</tt>
	section of the <tt>nbproject/project.xml</tt> file.
	<li><b>Export Packages Only to Friends.</b> Is checked if and only if there is at least one entry in
	the list below it. The list may include code name bases of other modules and is sorted. If not 
	empty, packages are kept in <tt>friend-packages</tt> instead and the friends are listed in <tt>nbproject/project.xml.</tt>
	<li><b>Provided Tokens.</b> Sets <tt>OpenIDE-Module-Provides</tt> in the <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file.
