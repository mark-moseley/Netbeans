	<h2>About NetBeans Plug-in Modules</h2>
	<p>A NetBeans plug-in module ("plug-in") is a Java archive (JAR) file which contains Java classes written to interact with the 
	<a href="about-open-apis.html">NetBeans Open APIs</a>. 
	A plug-in identifies 
	itself as a plug-in by an entry in its manifest file. NetBeans plug-ins are packaged as NBM files (<tt>.nbm</tt> extension) for non-installer
	distribution, usually via the NetBeans Update Center.

	<p>When an application based on a NetBeans platform is run, the platform's Main class is run. 
	It then finds the available plug-ins and builds an in-memory registry of them, and performs any 
	tasks they specify for startup. Generally, a plug-in's code is loaded into memory as it is needed.

	<p>Applications can install plug-ins dynamically - any application can include the Update Center plug-in,
	to allow users of that application to download digitally-signed upgrades and new features via the web,
	directly into the running application. Installing an upgrade or a new release does not force users to 
	download the entire application again. And in an application with multiple plug-ins, upgrades of specific
       	functionality can be incremental, further improving customer response time and time-to-market.
