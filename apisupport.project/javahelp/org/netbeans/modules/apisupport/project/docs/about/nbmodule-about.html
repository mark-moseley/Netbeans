    <h2>About Plug-in Modules and Rich-Client Applications</h2>

    <p>A NetBeans plug-in module is a Java archive (JAR) file which contains Java classes written to interact with the 
    <a href="about-open-apis.html">NetBeans APIs</a>. 
    A plug-in module identifies 
    itself as a module by an entry in its <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file.
    NetBeans plug-in modules are packaged as NBM files (<tt>.nbm</tt> extension) for non-installer
    distribution, usually via the Update Center wizard under the Tools menu.
    <p>NetBeans plug-in modules are written with one of two aims in mind:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Extending the IDE.</b> You can very easily generate skeleton
        code for extending the IDE's functionality with 
        new features. For example, you can use the skeleton code to write plug-in modules that make your favorite cutting-edge 
        technologies available to the NetBeans IDE. Or, if you miss some functionality in the IDE, you
        can add it yourself, by using the skeleton code to
        write a plug-in module that provides the desired functionality.
        <li><b>Building a rich-client application.</b> You can use the core of the IDE as a platform on 
        top of which you develop standalone desktop applications. The core of the IDE is a separate product
        called the <a href="about-netbeans-platform.html">NetBeans Platform</a>. By loading plug-in modules
        into the NetBeans Platform, you can save a lot of development time 
        by reusing the platform's existing features such as menus, toolbars, windowing systems. 
        
        <p>Even though it is a separate product, there is little need to download the NetBeans Platform separately&#8212;you can develop
        the rich-client application in the IDE and then exclude the plug-in modules that are specific
        to the IDE but that are superfluous to you application.
 
        
    </ul>
