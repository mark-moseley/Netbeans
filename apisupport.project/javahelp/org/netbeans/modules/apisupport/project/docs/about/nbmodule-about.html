    <h2>About NetBeans Modules</h2>
    <p><small> 
        <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> 
    </small></p>
    <p>A NetBeans module is a Java archive (JAR) file which contains Java classes written to interact with the 
    <a href="about-open-apis.html">NetBeans APIs</a>. 
    A module identifies 
    itself as a module by an entry in its <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file.
    NetBeans modules are packaged as NBM files (<tt>.nbm</tt> extension) for non-installer
    distribution, usually via the Plugin Manager under the Tools menu.
    <p>NetBeans modules are written with one of two aims in mind:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Extending the IDE.</b> You can very easily generate skeleton
        code for extending the IDE's functionality with 
        new features. For example, you can use the skeleton code to write modules that make your favorite cutting-edge 
        technologies available to the NetBeans IDE. Or, if you miss some functionality in the IDE, you
        can add it yourself, by using the skeleton code to
        write a module that provides the desired functionality.
        <li><b>Building a rich-client application.</b> You can use the core of the IDE as a platform on 
        top of which you develop standalone desktop applications. The core of the IDE is a separate product
        called the <a href="about-netbeans-platform.html">NetBeans Platform</a>. By basing your application on the NetBeans Platform, 
 you can save a lot of development time, because you can 
        reuse the platform's existing features such as menus, toolbars, and windowing systems. 
        
        <ul class="note"><li>Even though it is a separate product, there is little need to download the NetBeans Platform separately&#8212;you can develop
        the rich-client application in the IDE and then exclude the modules that are specific
        to the IDE but that are superfluous to your application. Only when
        you want to use a different <i>version</i> of the platform than is included in the IDE,
        does it make sense to download the NetBeans Platform and install
        the modules that define the application into it.</ul>
 
        
    </ul>
