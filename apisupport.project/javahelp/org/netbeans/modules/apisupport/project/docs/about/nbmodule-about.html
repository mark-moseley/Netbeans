	<p>A NetBeans module is a Java archive (JAR) file which contains Java classes written to interact with the 
	<a href="about-open-apis.html">NetBeans APIs</a>. 
	A module identifies 
	itself as a module by an entry in its <tt>MANIFEST.MF</tt> file.
       	NetBeans modules are packaged as NBM files (<tt>.nbm</tt> extension) for non-installer
	distribution, usually via the NetBeans Update Center.
	<p>NetBeans modules are written with one of two aims in mind:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Extending the IDE.</b> You can very easily extend the IDE's functionality with 
		new features. For example, you can write modules that make your favorite cutting-edge 
		technologies available to the NetBeans IDE. Or, if you miss some functionality in the IDE, you
		can add it yourself, by writing a module that provides the desired functionality.
		<li><b>Building a stand-alone application.</b> You can use the core of NetBeans as a platform on 
		top of which you develop rich client applications. The core of NetBeans is a separate NetBeans product
		called the <a href="about-netbeans-platform.html">NetBeans Platform</a>. You can save a lot of development time 
		by reusing features readily available in the NetBeans Platform. 
	</ul>
