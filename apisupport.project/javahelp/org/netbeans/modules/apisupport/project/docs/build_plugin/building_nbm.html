<p>An NBM file is a NetBeans module packaged for delivery via the web. 
The principal differences between NBM files and module JAR files are:
<ul><li>An NBM file can contain more than one JAR file&#8212;modules can package any libraries they use into their NBM file.
<li>An NBM file contains metadata that NetBeans will use to display information about it in the Update Center,
such as the manifest contents, the license, etc.
<li>An NBM file is typically <i>signed</i> for security purposes.</ul>

<p>NBM files are just ZIP files with a special extension. They use the JDK's mechanism 
for signing JAR files. Unless you are doing something unusual, you will not need to worry about the 
contents of an NBM file&#8212;just let the standard Ant build script for NBM creation take care of it for you. 


<p><b>To build an NBM file:</b>

<ol><li>In the Projects window, right-click the node of the module project you want to build.
	<li>Choose Create NBM.</ol>
