	<h2>Building an NBM File</h2>
<p><small>

<p>An NBM file is a NetBeans module packaged for delivery via the web. 
The principal differences between NBM files and a module JAR files are:
<ul><li>An NBM file is compressed.
<li>An NBM file can contain more than one JAR file -- modules can package any libraries they use into their NBM.
<li>An NBM file contains metadata NetBeans will use to display information about it in the update center,
such as the manifest contents, the license, etc.
<li>An NBM files is typically signed for security purposes.</ul>

<p>NBM files are just ZIP files with a special extension, which use the JDK's mechanism 
for signing jars. Unless you are doing something unusual, you will not need to worry about the 
contents of an NBM file -- just let the standard Ant build script for NBM creation take care of it for you. 
The IDE generates the build script based on the options you enter 
in the project's Project Properties dialog box. You can set the module's dependencies, versioning,
 and packaging information in the Project 
  Properties dialog box. You can further customize program execution by editing 
  the Ant script and Ant properties for the project. </p>

<p>You can customize the build process by doing any 
  of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enter basic options, like module dependencies</a>,
        packaging settings and versioning information in the Project 
	Properties dialog box.</li>
	<li>Customize
    the IDE-generated Ant targets or create new targets in <tt>build.xml</tt>. 
  </li>
  <li>Edit properties in <tt>project.properties</tt> to change the name and location 
    of build output folders and files.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To build an NBM file:</b>

<ol><li>In the Projects window, right-click the node of the module project you want to build.
	<li>Choose Create NBM.</ol>
