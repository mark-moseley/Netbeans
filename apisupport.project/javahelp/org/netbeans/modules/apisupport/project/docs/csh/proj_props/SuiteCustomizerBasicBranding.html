<h2>Module Suite Project Properties Dialog Box: Application</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 

<p>You open the Module Suite Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking 
a module suite project and choosing Properties. 

<p>The Application page specifies the look-and-feel of an application built on
top of the NetBeans Platform. Set the following properties:

<ul>
	<li><b>Create Collection of Add-on Modules.</b> Specifies that
	you do not want to create a standalone application. For example, in this case
	you might want to add the suite to an <i>existing</i> application, such as the IDE. Alternatively, you
 might be using the suite to add a library wrapper to a module, without wanting the module to be available
 as a standalone application. When you select
	this radiobutton, the remaining controls in this panel, and the Splash Screen subpanel, are not enabled.
	<li><b>Create Standalone Application.</b> Specifies that
	you want to create a standalone application, with branding details such as a splash screen, progress bar,
	 and application title. When you select this checkbox,
        the remaining controls in this panel, and the Splash Screen subpanel, are enabled.	
	<li><b>Branding Name.</b> Specifies the name of the application's executable.
	<li><b>Application Title.</b> Specifies the title that will appear in the application's titlebar.
	<li><b>Application Icon.</b> Specifies an icon with a dimension of 48x48 pixels, that will
	 be displayed in the application's About dialog box, which will be available
	 under the Help menu. Note that this icon does <i>not</i> set the executable's icon.
	 If you want to customize the executable's icon, you need to make use of an external
	 resource editor, many of which are freely available on-line.
</ul>
