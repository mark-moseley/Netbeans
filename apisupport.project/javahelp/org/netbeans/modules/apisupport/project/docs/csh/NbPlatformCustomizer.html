    <h2>NetBeans Platform Manager Dialog Box</h2>
    <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 

    <p>The NetBeans Platform Manager is a tool for registering different NetBeans platforms with the IDE.
    A NetBeans platform can be an installation of the <a href="../about/about-netbeans-platform.html">NetBeans Platform</a> or an
    installation of the NetBeans IDE.
    The NetBeans Platform Manager lists all your registered NetBeans platforms in the left pane and
    lists the platform that the IDE currently deploys to as the default.

    <p>You can open the NetBeans Platform Manager by choosing Tools &gt; NetBeans Platform Manager.

    <p>The NetBeans Platform Manager lets you view, select, or register the following:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Platform.</b> Lets you register a new NetBeans platform. A NetBeans platform
         can be the NetBeans Platform, the NetBeans IDE, or any derivative product. Once you
         have registered a NetBeans platform, associate it with a module project in its
         <a href="proj_props/CustomizerLibraries.html">Libraries</a> page.</li>
        <li><b>Modules.</b> Lets you view a registered platform's available modules.</li>
        <li><b>Sources.</b> Lets you register source code for a platform in the Sources
        tab. If you register the sources, you do not need to register Javadoc separately, because Javadoc is
        included in the sources. Either the ZIP file containing the sources or the unpacked root folder 
        can be registered in the Sources tab. You can download the NetBeans sources from <object CLASSID="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
            <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">
            <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html</u>.</html>">
            <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
            <param name="textColor" value="blue">
        </object></li>
        <li><b>Javadoc.</b> Lets you register Javadoc documentation
        for a platform in the Javadoc tab. Javadoc is available from the Update Center.
        Choose Tools &gt; Module Manager and then click Update.</li>

        <li><b>Harness.</b> Lets you register or select an alternative build harness.
        With a build harness, you can build plug-in modules outside of the netbeans.org CVS tree
        against a NetBeans-based application&#8212;the NetBeans Platform, the NetBeans IDE, or any
        derivative product. By default,
        the harness supplied by the current IDE installation is used. Some build functionality,
        such as setting a module project's target JDK, is supported by one harness but not
        by another.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have registered a platform, you can configure a module project to use
    that platform for deployment. Go to the project's Project
    Properties dialog box, select the Libraries node, and choose the appropriate
    platform in the NetBeans Platform drop-down list.
