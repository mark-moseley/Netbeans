Provides classes and interfaces for handling result sets returned by databases.
<p>
These classes are capable of retrieving, updating, inserting and deleting rows from
resultsets in a disconnected ({@link com.sun.sql.rowset.CachedRowSetX}) or connected
({@link javax.sql.rowset.JdbcRowSet}) manner.
</p>
<p>
The {@link com.sun.sql.rowset.CachedRowSetX} interface
is an extension of the {@link javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet} 
interface.  See {@link javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet} for how to use 
{@link javax.sql.rowset.JdbcRowSet}s.  See
{@link com.sun.sql.rowset.CachedRowSetX} for the details
of the extensions in this package.
</p>

This package also contains the following (see the
documentation each interface/class for details).
