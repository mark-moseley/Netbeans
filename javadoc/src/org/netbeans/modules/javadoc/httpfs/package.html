<h2>Standard Doclet HTTP Filesystem</h2>

This package takes advantage well-know format of reports generated by
standard JavaDoc doclet and parses it for content. It translates
generated documentation as readonly filesystem.

<p>
Known problem is that <code>getURL()</code> should return original external
file URL instead of internal <tt>nbfs:</tt>.
