OpenIDE-Module-Name=Java SE Projects
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Java
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Supports plain Java projects, such as for client-side Java SE.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Support for general Java projects, often Java SE (client-side). \
    A Java SE project can compile a Java source root, build a JAR from it, run JUnit-based tests, create Javadoc, and run or debug an application with a main class. \
    No direct support for Java EE or special packaging technologies. \
    Web service client support is included.

LBL_No_Main_Classs_Found=Class "{0}" does not have a main method.
LBL_No_Build_XML_Found=The project does not have a build script.
# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: This is a folder name, do not use odd characters:
#NOI18N
TXT_DefaultTestFolderName=test

# J2SEProjectGenerator
# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: COMMENT_* keys are used to create the initial project.properties
# for a project. The properties file format only accepts ISO-8859-1 characters in their
# raw form, i.e. Western European scripts. Any other characters (e.g. Asian) will be stored
# in the properties file correctly but be unreadable in text mode: \u1234 syntax is used.
# (The proper characters will be displayed only if the file is opened in the table editor.)
COMMENT_dist.dir=This directory is removed when the project is cleaned:
COMMENT_build.dir=This directory is removed when the project is cleaned:

COMMENT_run.jvmargs_2=(you may also define separate properties like run-sys-prop.name=value instead of -Dname=value
COMMENT_run.jvmargs_3=or test-sys-prop.name=value to set system properties for unit tests):
COMMENT_build.sysclasspath=Only compile against the classpath explicitly listed here:
COMMENT_javac.compilerargs=Space-separated list of extra javac options
COMMENT_debug.transport=Uncomment to specify the preferred debugger connection transport:
