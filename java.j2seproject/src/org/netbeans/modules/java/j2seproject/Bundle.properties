OpenIDE-Module-Name=J2SE Projects
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Java
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Supports plain J2SE projects, such as for client-side Java.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Support for general Java projects, usually J2SE (client-side). \
    A J2SE project can compile a Java source root, build a JAR from it, \
    run JUnit-based tests, create Javadoc, and run or debug an application \
    with a main class. No direct support for J2EE or special packaging \
    technologies.

LBL_No_Main_Classs_Found=Class "{0}" does not have a main method.
# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: This is a folder name, do not use odd characters:
#NOI18N
TXT_DefaultTestFolderName=test

# J2SEProjectGenerator
# NOTE TO TRANSLATORS: COMMENT_* keys are used to create the initial project.properties
# for a project. The properties file format only accepts ISO-8859-1 characters in their
# raw form, i.e. Western European scripts. Any other characters (e.g. Asian) will be stored
# in the properties file correctly but be unreadable in text mode: \u1234 syntax is used.
# (The proper characters will be displayed only if the file is opened in the table editor.)
