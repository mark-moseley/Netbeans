  <p>
  The Braces Matching SPI for implementing <code>BracesMatcher</code>s that can search
  through a document and find matching areas of text.
  </p>
  <p>
  Implementations of <code>BracesMatcherFactory</code> can be registered in <code>MimeLookup</code>
  under the mime type of documents that they wish to create <code>BracesMatcher</code>s for.
  </p>
  <p>
  The infrastructure behind the SPI registers a special highlighting layer for visualization of search results
  provided by registered matchers. The highlighting layer uses <code>Highlighting SPI</code> to
  colorify parts of a document in a text component that have been identified by matchers. The infrastructure also
  supplies an action for moving componet's caret between those areas. The action is registered
  for all supported document types and bound to a shortcut.
