/**
 * XXX Originally in insync.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Element for &lt;table&gt; elements. We need some extra state here to
 * be able to automatically handle CSS styling of tables missing tbody
 * elements.
 * The problem is that a html document like this:
 * <pre>
 *  &lt;style&gt;tbody {background: red}&lt;/style&gt;
 *  &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Hello&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
 * </pre>
 * should have a red background. That's because a &lt;tbody&gt; element should
 * "automatically" be inserted in the table.  I first tried an approach
 * where I actually inserted &lt;tbody&gt; elements during the parse, but
 * this didn't work right -- doing insertBefore calls during Xerces parse
 * caused the structure of the document to be wrong because it doesn't
 * seem to look at the return value from insertBefore. So I then changed
 * the code to try to "patch up" the table during the box creation phase;
 * this had the problem that the screen would refresh multiple times since
 * layout would be invalidated while rendering the page (table has changed)
 * and besides, I would have to acquire a write lock since I was modifying
 * the source dom (except for JSF-rendered tables in DocumentFragments);
 * and each write unlock would cause a flush, so documents with multiple
 * tables would cause multiple flushes. I then switched to a write lock
 * for the entire phase -- but this was getting to be a big ugly solution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * So I instead went for the following scheme:
 * When a &lt;table&gt; element is created, create a special subclass of
 * RaveElement for it. This subclass tracks the "tbody" child, if any.
 * On insert, any &lt;tr&gt; elements inserted directly on the table are put
 * in a "secret" tbody element. The tbody element is secret in that it
 * is not added to the DOM itself, but it is however linked stylewise
 * via the setStyleParent, such that my modified Batik CSS parser will
 * follow the style parent link for the &lt;tr&gt; to jump to the &lt;tbody&gt; first,
 * then the &lt;table&gt;, instead of directly to the &lt;table&gt;. This will cause
 * the (unconnected) &lt;tbody&gt; element to be styled too, and as a result,
 * the proper CSS inheritance and treatment of the &lt;tbody&gt; tag works.
 * </p>
