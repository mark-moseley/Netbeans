OpenIDE-Module-Name=UML
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=NetBeans 5.5, UML Modeling Module
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
The UML plugin enables model-driven analysis, design and implementation through the use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). It supports all major phases of the development lifecycle, from reverse engineering and html model reporting to user interaction and process modeling, on through to code generation and deployment of applications.\n\nThe UML plugin currently does not support Macintosh(tm) platforms due to known issues related with the delay in the Apple(tm) JDK development.  Note that Macintosh users can still use the UML plugin, but you may encounter the known issues.  Please refer to http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/UMLMacIssues for details on these issues.
