TXT_CannotGenerateService=Web Service can not be created by JAXWS:wsimport utility.\nReason: {0}\n\n\
There might be a problem during java artifacts creation: for example a name conflict in generated classes.\n\
To detect the problem see also the error messages in output window.\n\
You may be able to fix the problem in WSDL Customization dialog\n\
(Edit Web Service Attributes action)\n\
or by manual editing of the local wsdl or schema files, using the JAXB customization\n\
(local wsdl and schema files are located in Configuration Files -> xml-resources directory).\n\n\
After you fix the problem you need to refresh service from the Web Service node.
