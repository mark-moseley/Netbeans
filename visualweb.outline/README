which incorporates the provided component into the NB navigator.

This module takes care of retrieving the proper root nodes in accordance
to the activated nodes, which provide the corresponding DesignBeans.

It also manages the selection based on the changes selection of the global context
(affected by the selection in the designer itself), and also manages to synch

doesn't manage the contextual actions of particular nodes, nor their icons nor
their display names etc.
