                This service provides a programmatic login method you can use to access Google services protected by user login. 
                An installed application is installed on a device, such as a desktop computer or a cell phone, as opposed 
                to a web application. Programmatic login is available when accessing services that support the 
                Account Authentication service. With programmatic login implemented, you can log into your Google account 
                from inside the application. The application then contacts Google with the login data and requests 
                access to a specified Google service. Once access is authorized, you can create, read, update, or 
                delete service data as needed by using the application interface.

                                    HOSTED (authenticate as a hosted account only),

                                    information from the user. If the user information matches both a 
                                    hosted and a Google account, only the hosted account will be authenticated.
