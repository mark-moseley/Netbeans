/**
 * The DocumentModelProvider is responsible for parsing the text document
 * and updating the tree structure of elements held by DocumentModel. 
 * The provider accomplished this by adding a 'requests' to add or remove 
 * an element into the transaction. For more detailed information see 
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.editor.structure.api.DocumentModel.DocumentModelModificationTransaction}
 * <br>
 * When the model decides that there is a need to update the structure of the
 * elements (after there is a document change(s)) it calls the provider's 
 * update method. The model passes an instance of DocumentModelModificationTransaction,
 * the model itself and an array of changes made in the text document.
 * Then it's up to the provider implementation what parts of the document will
 * be reparsed and how the elements will be tailored. In principal the
 * provider can add or remove elements from the model. This is accomplished by
 * adding change requests into the transaction. Once the provider finishes its
 * work the model commits the transaction and the model structure is definitively
 * updated. 
 * <br>
 * When the text document is changed during the call of the update method, the
 * model cancels the transaction so next attempt to add something into the transaction
 * will cause DocumentModelTransactionCancelledException to be thrown. 
 * The provider should not catch this exception - it is a legal mechanism, how
 * to break no more valid model update.
 *
 * Instancies of this class are registered via layer mechanism into the 
 * IDE and associated with a particullar mime-types.
 *
 * The registration are read from the following folder in the system FS:
 * <pre>
 *     Editors/&lt;mime-type&gt;/DocumentModel
 * </pre>
