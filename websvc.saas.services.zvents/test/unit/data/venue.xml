      The Tech is a cosmopolitan museum singularly focused on technology,
      how it works and the way that it is changing every aspect of
      the way we work, live, play and learn. Its people-and-technology
      focus and the integration of advanced technologies into visitor
      experiences and infrastructure, distinguishes it from other science
      centers. The 132,000 square feet of The Tech are shared by four
      major theme galleries packed full of one-of-a-kind exhibits, the
      Hackworth IMAX Dome Theater, an educational center for workshops and
      labs, an upscale cafe, and a retail store featuring books, gifts,
      and only-in-Silicon Valley items. An estimated 650,000 visitors are
      expected to trek to The Tech each year, making it one of California's
      most popular destinations. The Tech began as a dream. In 1978,
      members of the Junior League of Palo Alto, later joined by the
      San Jose League, envisioned an exciting learning center devoted to
      science and technology in the heart of Silicon Valley. The vision
      for The Tech was realized in 1990 when a 20,000-square-foot temporary
      test facility was opened in the old convention center on San Carlos
      Street. Since then, The Tech has fine-tuned its mission of engaging
      people of all ages in the technologies that affect their daily lives
      and has built a reputation as a viable and necessary educational
      resource in the area of science and technology learning. It has
      also become a landmark for visitors seeking a glimpse of the most
      inventive place on Earth and a showcase of the latest high-tech gizmos
      and gadgets that put Silicon Valley on the map. Since the prototype
      Tech opened, approximately 2,800,000 visitors from all over the world
      have enjoyed a one-of-a-kind, up close view of Silicon Valley with
      hands-on, interactive exhibits, workshops, labs, a speakers series,
      an online exhibit hall and other activities, such as the annual Tech
      Challenge. This high-tech design contest has attracted nearly 8,000
      youth during the eleven years of the competition. Gallery Hours:
