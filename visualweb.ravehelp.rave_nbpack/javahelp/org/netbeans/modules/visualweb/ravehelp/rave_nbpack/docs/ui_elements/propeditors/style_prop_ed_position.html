<h1>Style Editor: Position Panel</h1>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>This panel of the the <a href="style_prop_ed_main.html">Style 
  Editor</a> enables you to add position-related cascading style 
  sheet (CSS) declarations to the style property of a JavaServer 
  Faces component. The declarations you add to the style property 
  override corresponding CSS rules defined in the page's CSS file.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>The Visual Designer by default is in grid mode. In that mode, the Visual Designer sets the 
<code>position</code> CSS property to <code>absolute</code> in each component's style property. If you change the position value in this dialog and then move the component in Visual Designer while the editor is in grid mode, the Visual Designer will reset <code>position</code> to <code>absolute</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Position panel enables you to set the following style declarations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Position.</b> Sets the CSS property  <code>position</code>, which determines
  where the component is displayed on the page. Takes one of the following values:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Absolute.</b> The component is positioned relative to its containing
        block. The positioning is a set distance from the edges of the containing
        block and depends on the settings of the positioning properties Top,
        Bottom, Left, and Right. </li>
      <li><b>Static.</b> The component is positioned relative to its parent and
        to other components that precede it. None of the positioning properties
        (Top,
        Bottom, Left, and Right) apply. </li>
      <li><b>Relative.</b> The component is positioned a specified distance away
        from its normal position without respect to the positioning of other
        elements, meaning that it can overlap other elements. The positioning
        depends on the settings of the positioning properties Top, Bottom, Left,
        and Right. </li>
      <li><b>Fixed.</b>  The component is positioned relative to the browser
        window and does not move when other elements are scrolled. The positioning
        depends on the settings of the positioning properties Top, Bottom, Left,
        and Right. </li>
      <li><b>Inherit.</b> The component inherits the position setting of its
        parent component.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li> If you enter a number in any of the following fields and the field has a
  disabled drop-down list next to it for setting numeric units, press the Enter
  key after entering the number to enable the drop-down list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Top.</b> Sets the CSS property <code>top</code>, which determines how
    far from the top of the containing block the component is to be positioned.
  This setting does not apply if Position is set to static. </li>
  <li><b>Bottom.</b> Sets the CSS property <code>bottom</code>, which determines
    how far from the bottom of the containing block the component is to be positioned.
  This setting does not apply if Position is set to static. </li>
  <li><b>Left.</b> Sets the CSS property <code>left</code>, which determines
    how far from the left of the containing block the component is to be positioned.
  This setting does not apply if Position is set to static. </li>
  <li><b>Right.</b> Sets the CSS property  <code>right</code>, which determines
    how far from the top of the containing block the component is to be positioned.
    This setting does not apply if Position is set to static. </li>
  <li><b>Width.</b> Sets the CSS property <code>width</code>, which determines the
    width of the component if Position is set to Absolute. </li>
  <li><b>Height.</b>  Sets the CSS property <code>height</code>, which determines
  the height of the component if Position is set to Absolute. </li>
  <li><b>Visible.</b>  Sets the CSS property <code>visible</code>, which determines
  if the component can be seen on the rendered page. </li>
  <li><b>Z-Index.</b> Sets the CSS property <code>z-index</code>, which determines
    the <i>stack order</i> of the component: whether
    the component displays on top of or behind other components. A negative value
    puts the component behind its containing block. </li>
  <li><b>Clip. </b>Sets the CSS property <code>clip:rect</code>, which defines a
    clipping rectangle that makes the parts of the component between the component's
    border and edges of the clipping rectangle transparent, effectively clipping,
    or cutting off, parts of the rendered component. </li>
</ul>
