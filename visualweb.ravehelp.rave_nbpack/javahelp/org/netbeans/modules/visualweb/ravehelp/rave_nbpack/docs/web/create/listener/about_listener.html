<h2>About Web Application  Listeners</h2>

<p>Listeners allow you more control over interactions with the <tt>ServletContext</tt> 
  and <tt>HttpSession</tt> objects and let you efficiently manage the resources 
  used by a web application.</p>
<p>Application event listeners are classes that implement one or more of the servlet 
  event listener interfaces. Application events let listener objects be notified 
  when servlet contexts and sessions are initialized and destroyed, as well as 
  when attributes are added or removed from a context or session.</p>
<p>Use Servlet context listeners to manage resources or state held at a virtual 
  machine level for the web application. The IDE helps you create two types of context 
  event listeners:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ServletContextListener</tt></b>, which notifies you that the 
    servlet context has just been created and is available to service its first 
    request, or that the servlet context is about to be shut down.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ServletContextAttributesListener</tt></b>, which notifies you 
    that attributes on the servlet context have been added, removed, or replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use HTTP session listeners to manage state or resources associated with a series 
  of requests made to a web application from the same client or users. The IDE helps 
  you create two types of session event listeners: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>HttpSessionListener</tt></b>, which notifies you that an HttpSession 
    has been created, invalidated, or timed out.</li>
  <li><b><tt>HttpSessionAttributesListener</tt></b>, which notifies you that 
    attributes have been added, removed, or replaced on an HttpSession.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Servlet request listeners to observe as requests are created and destroyed, 
   and as attributes are added and removed from a request. This is supported by
   J2EE 1.4 only. The IDE helps you create 
   two types of request event listeners:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>ServletRequestListener</tt></b>, which notifies you that the 
    request is coming in or out of a web application's scope.</li>
  <li><b><tt>ServletRequestAttributesListener</tt></b>, which notifies you 
    that request attributes have been added, removed, or replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listener classes are declared in the deployment descriptor (<tt>web.xml</tt>) 
  using the <tt>listener</tt> element. They are listed by class name in the 
  order in which they are to be invoked.</p>
  <p>The IDE provides a wizard to help you create listener classes.</p>
