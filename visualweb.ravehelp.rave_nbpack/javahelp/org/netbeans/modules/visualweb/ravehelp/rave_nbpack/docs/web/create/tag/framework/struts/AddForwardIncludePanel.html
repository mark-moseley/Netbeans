Writing an action means subclassing one of the <tt>Action</tt> classes and then overriding the class's <tt>execute</tt> method. Use the <a href="file_ActionPanel.html">New Struts Action wizard</a> for this purpose.<p>In some exceptional scenarios, you do not need an action to execute, but you <i>do</i> want to redirect to a new JSP page. In these exceptional scenarios, you have two options: <ul>	 <li><b>Forward Action.</b> Specifies a bridge from the JSP page to another JSP page or an action.	   <li><b>Include Action.</b> Specifies the same as a forwardaction, except that the JSP page or action	    is going to be included by another JSP page or action.     </ul><ul class="note">	<li>When you use the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box,	the <tt>forward</tt> or <tt>include</tt> is an attribute, rather than an element. The attribute	   makes the mapping functionally equivalent to the element, however, the tag is shorter.</ul><p>You use the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box to register an action forward or an action include in the <tt>struts-config.xml</tt> file.You open the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box by right-clicking in a <tt>struts-config.xml</tt> file andchoosing Struts &gt; Add Forward/Include Action.<p>In the Add Forward/Include Action dialog box, you set the following properties:<ul><li><b>Action Path.</b> Specifies the application context-relative path to the action.</li><li>Action Type. <ul>	 <li><b>Forward Action.</b> Specifies a bridge from the JSP page to another JSP page or an action.	   <li><b>Include Action.</b> Specifies the same as a forwardaction, except that the JSP page or action	    is going to be included by another JSP page or action.     </ul><li>Call.<ul>	<li><b>Resource File.</b> Specifies the path to the JSP page that handles the action.</li>	<li><b>Action.</b> Specifies the action that handles the forwardaction or includeaction.</li></ul></ul><ul class="note">	<li>If you want to change a registered forwardaction or includeaction, you can do	so by manually editing the XML tags in the <tt>struts-config.xml</tt> file.</ul><dl>    <dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt>  <dd><a href="../about_framework.html">About Web Application Frameworks</a></dd><dd>  <a href="../framework_struts_create.html">Creating a New Application with Struts Support</a></dd><dd>  <a href="../framework_struts_add.html">Adding Struts Support to an Existing Application</a></dd></dl><hr><small><a href="../../../../../credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small> <table cellpadding="20" border="0"> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> </table> </body></html>
