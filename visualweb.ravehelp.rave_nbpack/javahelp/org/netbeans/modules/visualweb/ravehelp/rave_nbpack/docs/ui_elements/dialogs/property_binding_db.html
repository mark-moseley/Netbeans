<h1>Property Bindings Dialog Box</h1>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> | <small><a href="#tutorials">Tutorials</a></small></p>

<p>This dialog box opens when you right-click a component that you have added to a page and choose Property Bindings. </p>
<p>The dialog box enables you to create an association between a property of a component and a property of a JavaBeans object or data provider that is visible from the current page. Many component properties are <i>bindable</i>: They can be attached to other 
values in the application, such as  to other components, component properties, 
or to hosted services such as databases or web services, and be dynamically changed when the application runs. </p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>If you  want to bind the default display property of a component, like a Text Field component's <code>text</code> property, choose Bind to Data instead. A Bind to Data dialog box will open that is appropriate for the type of component and might aid you in making a good choice for the binding. For more information, see <a href="../../components/howtocomponents/bind_comp_props.html">Binding Component Properties</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>A typical use of this dialog box is to bind a component property to a property of a managed bean, like SessionBean1. You might also use this dialog box to bind the <code>selected</code> property of a list component like Drop Down List to an object that picks up its value when the user makes a selection. But there are many possibilities for binding properties and enabling them to dynamically change at runtime. </p>
<p>The dialog box has two lists:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Select Bindable Property.</b> This list shows all the properties of the component that can be bound. Select the property that you want to bind from this list. If a property is currently bound, the property and its target are both shown as selected. </li>
  <li><b>Select Binding Target. </b>This list shows all the properties and data provider keys to which you can bind a component. Navigate to the item that you want and select it. If you  drop a database table, a web service, or an Enterprise JavaBeans object on the same page as the component, when you open this dialog box, you can bind a component property to one of the data provider's keys.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="warning">
  <li>You must click the Apply button next to the New Binding Expression field for each property that you want to bind. After clicking Apply, you see the binding added to the Current Binding for <i>property-name </i>Property field.  If you click OK without clicking Apply, the property is not bound. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you click the Apply button, you can also see if the selection was permitted. For example, the <code>items</code> property of a JavaServer Faces 1.2 Drop Down List must be bound to a property representing array, a <code>java.util.Collection</code>, or a <code>java.util.Map</code> of <code>com.sun.webui.jsf.model.Option</code>  objects. If you bind it to some other type of property and click Apply, you see a Component Error message in the Visual Designer. Read the help topic for the component's Properties window to see if there are limits on the type of bindings you can do with a property. </p>
<ul class="note">
<li>
For a JavaServer Faces 1.1 drop-down list used by a J2EE 1.4 project, the package is different. The Option object is in the package <code>com.sun.rave.web.ui.model.Option</code>.
</li>
</ul>
