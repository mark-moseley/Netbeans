Click Filters at the top of the editor to open the Filters view. </p><p>First, click Add Filter Element to define the filter element with the following properties:</p><ul><li><b>Filter Name. </b>Specifies the filter's display name, such as <tt>LoginFilter</tt>.</li><li><b>Description. </b> Specifies a description, such as <tt>Performs pre- and post-login operations</tt>.</li><li><b>Filter Class. </b>Specifies the filter's class, such as <tt>MyLoginFilterClass</tt>.</li></ul><p>Next, click Add within the filter element and define its initialization parameters:</p><ul><li><b>Param Name. </b>Specifies the parameter's display name, such as <tt>encoding</tt>.</li><li><b>Param Value. </b>Specifies the parameter's value, such as <tt>UTF-8</tt>.</li><li><b>Description. </b> Specifies a description, such as <tt>Acceptable encoding formats</tt>.</li></ul><p>Finally, click Add in the Filter Mappings section to map the filter to servlets or URL patternsto which the filter applies:</p><ul><li><b>Filter Name. </b>Selects the filter to which the mapping applies, such as <tt>LoginFilter</tt>.</li><li><b>Apply To. </b>Specifies the URL pattern or servlet to which the filter applies, such as <tt>/Authenticate</tt>.</li><li><b>Dispatcher types. </b> Constrains how the filter will be applied to requests:<ul><li><b>Request.</b> (Default) Only when the request come directly from the client.</li>	<li><b>Forward.</b> Only when the request has been forwarded to a component.</li>	<li><b>Include.</b> Only when the request is being processed by a component that has been included.</li>	<li><b>Error.</b> Only when the request is being processed with the error page mechanism.</li></ul><p>You can select one or more of the dispatcher types above.</p></li></ul><p>Note that when you click Remove at the top of the Servlet Filters section,  you remove the filter's deployment information from the <tt>web.xml</tt> file, but you do not remove the filter itself. To delete the filter,  right-click it in the Projects window and choose Delete.</p><dl>	<dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt>	<dd><a href="../../create/filter/about_filter.html">About Servlet Filters</a></dd>	<dd><a href="nbdocs:/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/platform/docs/ejb/general/about_deployment_descriptors.html">About Deployment Descriptors</a></dd>	<dd><a href="../../configure/about_webapp_configure.html">About Configuring Web Applications</a></dd>       <dd><a href="../../configure/configure_webapp_dd.html">Configuring Web Application Deployment Descriptors</a></dd>      </dl> <hr><font size=-2><a href="../../../credits.html">Legal Notices</a></font> <table border="0" cellpadding="20">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
