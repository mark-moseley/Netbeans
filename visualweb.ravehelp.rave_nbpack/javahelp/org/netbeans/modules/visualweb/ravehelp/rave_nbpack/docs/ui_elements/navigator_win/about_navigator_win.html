<h2>About the Navigator Window</h2>

<p>The 
  <object classid=java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer>
    <param name="content" value="navigator_win_popup.html">
    <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
    <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
    <param name="viewerSize" value="350,450">
    <param name="text" value="Navigator window"></object>
  &nbsp;  provides you with a hierarchical view of the objects 
  in your application, both visible objects, such as components, and nonvisual 
  objects, such as RowSets, Validators, and Converters. To open the Navigator window, in the main toolbar, choose 
  Window &gt; Navigating &gt; Navigator.</p>
<p>The contents of this window change depending on what you are currently editing. When a visual JavaServer Faces page is open in Design mode in the Visual Designer, you see a node for the current page in the application 
  plus all the non-page managed beans, such as any session beans, application beans, 
  or request beans.  The following list describes each node:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>page-name</i> node.</b> The <i>page-name</i> node shows all the 
  	objects on the current page, including nonvisual objects like database table 
    RowSets, Validators, and Converters. The runtime scope of each page is Request, meaning that information is 
    not saved between page requests.</li>
  <li><b>The beans nodes</b>. Bean properties are reflected here. You can edit the code for a bean in the 
  Java Editor by right-clicking the bean and choosing Edit Java Source. You typically add bean properties to a managed bean as described in <a href="../../web/about/webapps_quickref.html">Web Application  Tasks: Quick Reference</a>.</li>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>RequestBean node.</b> This bean has a runtime scope of Request. A request is a single transmission of an HTTP request from the client to the server plus the corresponding response, which can be another page. In most cases, the request begins with the clicking of a button or a link and ends with the response of an HTML page to be displayed. Use this bean to store information that you  need to preserve for only a single user request, such as information to pass to the next page. Any value that you store in the Request Bean disappears as soon as the request ends.</li>
  	<li><b>SessionBean node.</b> By default, there is one session 
   	 	bean for each project. This bean has a runtime scope of Session. Use this 
		bean to  store information that you want to preserve 
  		across page requests for a single user session, such as a user's logon information.</li>
  	<li><b>ApplicationBean node.</b> By default, there is one 
    	application bean for each project. This bean has a runtime 
    	scope of Application and is where you store information that 
  		you want to preserve across all user sessions, such as the contents of 
        a drop down list showing a list of all countries.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Using the Navigator Window</h3>
<p>You can use this window as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li> You can drop components directly from the Palette or <object classid=java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer>
    <param name="content" value="../../ui_elements/server_nav/services_win_popup.html">
    <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
    <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
    <param name="viewerSize" value="325,175">
    <param name="text" value="Services window"></object>  
  on 
  components in the Navigator window to determine the parent object.  You can drop between components (when there are multiple 
  siblings) to control&nbsp; where in the list a child appears, 
  such as for the children of a grid panel. </li>
  <li>You can reorder, and reparent, components by dragging them around&nbsp; within 
  the outline. For example you can drag a button from the form into a grid panel 
  component for example, or back out. </li>
  <li>You can work with elements of a page that 
      are  hard to select in the Visual Designer because they 
      are not visual or they are embedded in other components or simply referenced 
    by those components. For example, the checkbox group is composed of several other 
	components.  If you select the <code>checkboxGroup</code> component in the 
 	Navigator window you can bind it to a bean property or database that will provide 
  	the options displayed in the component. For more information, 
  	see <a href="../palette/jsfstd/checkbox_list.html">Checkbox 
  	Group Component</a>. 
</li>
  <!--
  <li>Select visual and nonvisual components and copy or move 
    them to other pages.</li>
  <li>Select nonvisual components and move them to the session 
    bean or application bean. Doing so changes the scope of a 
    component from request scope to session or application scope.</li>
-->
  <li>Select a component's node and edit  it. Right-click the node and choose Edit  Java Source or Edit JSP Source. When a component node is highlighted in the Navigator window, you can edit its properties in the <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/files/files_properties.html">Properties window</a>.</li>
  <li>Right-click a component's node and work with the same contextual 
  menu choices as you would in the Visual Designer.</li>
  <li>You can double-click any of the managed beans, such as SessionBean1, and edit the bean's source code. You typically do this when you want to add a property to the bean. </li>
