Instead the JSP must be accessed             through another JSP or through a servlet. You might want to put a             JSP file under the <tt>WEB-INF</tt> folder to prevent users from             using the JSP file as an entry point to the application.</li></ul><p><b>To create a JSP file:</b></p><ol><li>From the Projects window or Files window, right-click the project's node   and choose New &gt; Other   from the pop-up menu.   </li>  <li>Under Categories, select Web. Under File Types, select JSP. Click Next. </li>  <li>Type the name of your JSP. Do not include     a filename extension as this is added automatically when the file is created.     </li>    <li>Click Browse to select a folder to house your JSP file. By default, the    JSP file is created in the <tt>web</tt> subfolder.</li>    <li>Select the type of JSP file that you want to create:    <ul><li><b>JSP File (Standard Syntax).</b> Standard JSP pages are written using 	    the <a href="about_jsp_syntax.html#standard">standard JSP syntax</a>. 	    Standard JSP pages typically use the <tt>.jsp</tt> extension.</li>	    <li><b>JSP Document (XML Syntax).</b> JSP documents are written 	    using the <a href="about_jsp_syntax.html#document">JSP document syntax</a>, 	    which is well formed XML. JSP documents typically have the 	    <tt>.jspx</tt> extension. Two examples of the advantages that JSP documents 	    have over standard JSP pages are:</li>	    <ul><li>You can edit, verify, and view them with XML capable tools, 		    such as the IDE's Source Editor.</li>		    <li>You can transform them using XSLT tools, such 		    as the IDE's XSL Transformation command.</li></ul>	    </ul>    </li>    <li>(Optional) Click the Create as a JSP Segment checkbox.    A segment is a file that contains a fragment of JSP text for inclusion     by standard JSP pages and JSP documents. JSP segments typically use the <tt>.jspf</tt> extension.</li>    <li>Click Finish. The IDE opens the JSP file for editing in the Source Editor.</li></ol> <dl><dt><a name="seealso">See also</a><dd><a href="../../about/about_webapps.html">About Web Applications</a></dd><dd><a href="about_jsp_technology.html">About JavaServer Pages Technology</a></dd><dd><a href="about_jsp_syntax.html">About JSP Syntax</a></dd> <dd><a href="about_jsp_encoding.html">About JSP Character Encoding</a></dd><dd><a href="jsp_edit.html">Editing a JSP or HTML File</a></dd></dl><hr><small><a href="../../../credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small> </body></html>
