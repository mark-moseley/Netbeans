        <h2>Profiling a Web Application</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>There are two ways to profile a web application project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a stand-alone web application project</li>
  <li>As part of an enterprise application</li>
</ul>
<p>If your web application is part of an enterprise application, you should always 
    profile it by running the profile command on the enterprise application project. 
    Since the IDE does not know which enterprise applications a web application project
    belongs to, running the Profile command on a web application project deploys it 
    as a stand-alone application.</p>
    
    <p>If you are deploying your web application or enterprise application to a local installation
    of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish, you can profile your project by 
    choosing Profile Main Project from the main menu or choosing Profile from the pop-up menu in the
    Projects window.</p>
    
    <p>If you are deploying your web application or enterprise application to a remote server,
    you need to attach the IDE to the remote server and profile the application in Attach mode.
    The Attach Wizard can help you configure the remote server to accept attachment.</p>

<p><b>To profile a stand-alone web application:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Projects window, right-click the web application project and choose Profile. </li>
  <li>Select a profiling task and click Run.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you profile a stand-alone web application project, the IDE does the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compiles the web application if necessary.</li>
  <li>Stops the application server and starts it in profile mode.</li>
  <li>Deploys the web application to the application server.</li>
  <li>Starts a profiling session, attaches the profiler to the server, and opens the Profiler window in the IDE. 
    After the application is deployed to the server, you should invoke its code the same way as you would for debugging or 
    just evaluating application functionality. 
    You can view the profiling data once the code of the application is invoked.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To profile an enterprise application:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Projects window, right-click the enterprise application project and choose Profile.</li>
  <li>Select a profiling task and click Run.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
    <li>If you are analyzing application performance, you may want to choose the Profile Projects &amp;
    Subprojects Classes filter if you want to profile the classes in your web application and
    also any sub-projects, such as any EJB modules. If you do not choose this filter, the classes in 
    the EJB module are not profiled.
    <p>You can limit the classes in the enterprise application that are profiled by doing the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Analyze Performance pane, choose the Profile Projects &amp;
        Subprojects Classes filter and then click Show Filter Value.</li> 
    <li>Click to Quickfilter in the dialog box.</li>
    <li>In the Set Quick Filter dialog, select a filter type and edit the filter values
        to limit the classes that are profiled and click OK.</li>
    <li>Make sure that Quick Filter is selected in the Filter drop-down list when you run the profiling session.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ul>

<p>When you profile an enterprise application, the IDE does the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compiles the EAR file if necessary.</li>
  <li>Stops the application server and starts it in profile mode.</li>
  <li>Deploys the enterprise application to the application server.</li>
  <li>Starts a profiling session, attaches the profiler to the server, and opens 
    the Profiler window in the IDE. If the application has 
    a designated web application and URL to run, the IDE opens the URL in the 
    external browser.</li>
</ul>
