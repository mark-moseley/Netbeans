<h2>About Configuring Web Applications</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You configure your web applications at several different levels.</p>
<h3>Project Contents and Classpath</h3>
<p>Basic project settings like the web application's source roots and classpath are 
  set in the application's Project Properties dialog box. You open this dialog box 
  by right-clicking the web application's project node and choosing Properties.</p>
<p>For standard projects, you can add source roots in the Sources page of the 
  Project Properties dialog box. You can quickly add to the compilation and test 
  classpath by right-clicking the Libraries or Test Libraries node in the Projects 
  window. To further configure the classpath, or to specify which items should 
  be included in deployment, use the Libraries page of the Project Properties 
  dialog box.</p>
<p>For free-form projects, there are no Libraries or Test Libraries nodes. The 
  classpath and source roots are managed completely by your project's Ant script. 
  In the Java Sources and Java Sources Classpath pages of the Project Properties dialog box, you just 
  configure the project to match the settings that already exist in your Ant script. 
  This tells the IDE which classes to offer for debugging, code completion, and 
  so forth.</p>
<h3>Deployment Settings</h3>
<p>There are several key steps to configuring deployment settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Setting the target server.</b> You can have several instances of your favorite server 
  registered. You can set the target server instance for a web application by doing 
    any of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>Specifying the server in the New Project wizard when creating the project.</li>
      <li>Going to an web application's Project Properties dialog box and setting the 
        target server in the Run page.</li>
      <li>Adding the web application to an enterprise application. The web application is then 
        deployed to the same server instance as the enterprise application.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Adding the web application to a J2EE application.</b> You can add a web application 
    to an enterprise project by doing any of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>Specifying the enterprise application in the New Project wizard when 
        creating the project.</li>
      <li>Right-clicking the J2EE Modules node for any enterprise application 
        project and choosing Add J2EE Module.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Configuring deployment descriptors.</b> The IDE automatically updates 
    your deployment descriptors as you code your web application. Whenever you insert 
    a call to an enterprise bean, for example, the IDE automatically 
    enters the necessary information in your deployment descriptors. You can manually 
    configure your deployment descriptors by expanding the web application's Configuration 
    Files node and double-clicking <tt>web.xml</tt>, <tt>sun-web.xml</tt>, or <tt>context.xml</tt>.</li>
</ul>
