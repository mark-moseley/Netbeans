In addition, you can use this dialog box to create, delete,  rename, and change the color codes of virtual forms. You open the dialog box by right-clicking  a component in a page in the Visual Designer and choosing Configure Virtual Forms. If this choice is not available, the component is not one that can participate in a virtual form. Try right-clicking an input component, like a text field, or a button or hyperlink.</p><p>The dialog box presents each virtual form as a row with cells for the form's color and name and cells indicating if the component that opened the form is a participant in the form or a submitter for the form or both. </p><ul>  <li>To add the component to a virtual form as a participant in the form, click the Participate cell for the form. If you see a drop down list, the component can be added. Choose yes to add it.     <p>You can add a component as a participant to more than one virtual form. A component can be both a participant and a submitter in the same virtual form.</p>  </li>  <li>To add the component to a virtual form as the component that submits the form, click the Submit column. A component can submit only one virtual form, but can participate in more than one form. </li>  <li>To change the color associated with a virtual form, click the Color cell and select a color from the list. </li>  <li>To rename a virtual form, double click the Name cell and edit the name.</li>  <li>You can also create and delete virtual forms by clicking the New and Delete buttons. You cannot delete the last virtual form on the page. </li></ul><dl><dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt>	<dd><a href="../../components/aboutvirtualforms.html">About Virtual Forms</a></dd>	<dd><a href="virtual_forms_db.html">Virtual Forms Dialog Box</a></dd></dl><hr><!-- Start Customer Feedback Link --><!-- <p><b>Comments or questions?</b><br>Use the link below to connect to the Visual Web Development contact page. </p>  <object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">    <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkButton">    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/about/contact_form.html?to=4&subject=Feedback:%20Web%20Application%20Help:%20Configure Virtual Forms  Dialog Box">    <param name="text" value="<html><u>Click here to send feedback</u></html>"></object><br> --> <!-- End Customer Feedback Link -->  <small><a href="../../credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small> <table cellpadding="50" border="0">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
