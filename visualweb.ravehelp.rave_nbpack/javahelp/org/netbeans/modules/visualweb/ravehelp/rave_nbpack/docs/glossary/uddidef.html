<h4>UDDI - Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration</h4>
<p>UDDI is a specification for a service directory or registry. UDDI directories 
  contain the descriptions of web services, including what a service is for, who 
  created the service, and how to connect to a service. </p>
<p>UDDI automates the processes of finding service partners and working with partners 
  over the Internet. A UDDI directory can be searched, and it provides most of 
  the information necessary to locate a needed business service and to connect 
  to that service.</p>
