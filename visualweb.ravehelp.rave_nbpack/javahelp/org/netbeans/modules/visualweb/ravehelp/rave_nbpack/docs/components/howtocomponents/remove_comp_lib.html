    <h2>
    Removing a Component Library</h2>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>
    If you previously added a component library containing a set of JavaServer Faces components that were
      provided by a component vendor, this topic tells you how you can remove references to the library from a project or delete  the
      component library altogether. </p>
    <p>The <a href="../../ui_elements/dialogs/component_library_manager.html">Component Library Manager</a> has a Remove button that removes a component library from the <code>.netbeans</code> directory and removes all its components from the palette. However, this action does not remove any component libraries that are embedded in  projects.</p>
 <ul class="note">
<li>If you remove a component library from the IDE and then open a project that continues to use that component library, you will be prompted to add the component library back into the IDE so the components can be displayed in the Palette, thus undoing the removal.</li>
</ul>
    <p><b>To remove the component library  from a project:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <i>project-name</i> node in the
        <object classid=java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer>
        <param name="content" value="../../ui_elements/project_nav/project_nav_win.html">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="350,560">
        <param name="text" value="Projects window.">
      </object>
 </li>
      <li>If your project is using component from the library, remove those components from your project's pages before removing the library. 
        <ul class="note">
<li>Removing the components while the library is still referenced reduces the amount of code cleanup you have to perform. After removing the components, you still have to do some manual code cleanup, such as removing the import statements from page beans that used the components and removing any event handling methods that you created for those components. You can do this cleanup either before or after removing the library. 
</li>
</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Open the Component Libraries node and right-click the library you want to remove, and then choose Remove.</li>
      <li>You see a message warning that removing the library can cause errors in your projects. If you are using no components from the library in your project, click OK to remove the library. </li>
  </ol>
    
    <p>
       <b>To delete a component library from the IDE:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose Tools &gt; Component Libraries. </li>
      <li>
        In the Component Library Manager, select the library you want to delete and click the
        Remove button at the bottom of the window.
<ul class="note">
<li>You might see a message saying that you have projects open that use the library. If so, click OK in the message and close the Component Library Manager, and then close those projects. You can then reopen the Component Library Manager and start over.</li>
</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Confirm that you want to delete the library.
<p>The library is removed from your user directory. Any projects that use the library can continue to do so because they have their own copy of the library in the project directory.</p>
</li>
  </ol>
