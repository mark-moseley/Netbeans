  The following figure is a screen shot of a Property Sheet component that presents a data entry form with some required entry fields. Each required field has a red asterisk in front of it. Most of the entry fields are Text Field components that were dropped on the corresponding Property component in the Navigator window. The label for each entry field was set by typing text into the <code>label</code> property of the Property component. For each required entry field that contains a Text Field component, the required field icon was set by selecting the Text Field component's <code>required</code> property. The &quot;* Indicates required field&quot; hint at the top of the property sheet is displaying because the Property Sheet component's <code>requiredFields</code> property was set. </td>
