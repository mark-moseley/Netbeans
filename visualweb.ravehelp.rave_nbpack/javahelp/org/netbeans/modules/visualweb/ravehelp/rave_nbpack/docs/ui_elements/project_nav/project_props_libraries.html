<p>The Libraries panel of the Project Properties dialog box enables you to set the class library resources that make up the compile-time classpath for your project. You can include a library in the the application WAR file by selecting the Package checkbox.  You can open the Project Properties dialog box from the <a href="../../ui_elements/project_nav/projectlogical.html">Projects window</a> by right-clicking a main project node and choosing Properties.
  <!--explain source level?-->
Then, in the Categories list on the left side, select the   Libraries node.</p>
<p>If you want to change the version of the Java language that you are using for your application, choose another version from the <b>Java Platform</b> drop-down list. You can click <b>Manage Platforms </b> to add more versions of the Java language to this list. </p>
<p>  The  <b>Compile-time Libraries </b>box lists the class library resources that make up the compile-time classpath for your project. You can select the Package checkbox to the right of a library to include the library in the application WAR file. </p>
<p>You can add the following items to the current project's classpath: </p>
<ul>
  <li> The output of a project (usually a JAR file). You can open the Add Project dialog box by clicking the <b>Add Project button</b>. When you add a project, the IDE sets up a dependency such that the required project is built or re-built when the current project is built. You can disable this behavior by clearing the Build Required Projects checkbox at the bottom of the panel.</li>
  <li>The JAR files referenced by a selected library. You can open the Add Library dialog box by clicking the <b>Add Library button </b>. The Add Library dialog box display  a list of pre-defined libraries. You can create additional libraries by clicking Manage Libraries.</li>
  <li>JAR files or folders. You can navigate to a JAR file or folder to add by clicking the <b>Add JAR/Folder button</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the  buttons on the right side of the panel described above, you can use the <b>Remove</b> button to remove items and the <b>Move Up</b> and <b>Move Down</b> buttons to  change the order of items.
<p>There is a checkbox at the bottom of the page labeled <b>Build Required Projects (Libraries and Additional WAR Content)</b>. By default, all projects required by your project are compiled when you build your project. You can uncheck this box to speed up compilation at the risk of not having some required projects up to date.
