<h2>HTTP Authentication  dialog box</h2>

<p>It would not be safe to ship web servers with default settings that allowed 
anyone on the Internet to execute them on your server. 
Therefore, the web servers are shipped with the requirement that anyone 
who attempts to use them must authenticate themselves, using a username and password 
with the appropriate role associated with them.</p> 

<p>For example, to authenticate yourself when you want to use
   the Tomcat Manager to deploy your web application, 
   you need a username
   and password for a user with the "manager" role. 
   This username and password are defined in the
   <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file that is in your user
   directory.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      
    <td><img src="../../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      
    <td> You can only use the usernames and passwords that are defined in the 
      IDE's <b>user</b> directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file, and not those 
      that are in the IDE's <b>installation</b> directory. </td>
   </tr>
</table>
<p> During installation, the IDE generates a user called "ide" that is assigned 
  the "manager" role. This user is created in your user directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> 
  file.</p>
<b>To get the password for the "ide" username from your user directory:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Select Help &gt; About 
    from the main menu and choose the Detail tab.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the path to the User Dir folder.</li>
  <li>In your file system, go to your User Dir and then to the <tt>jakarta-tomcat-5.5.x_base\conf</tt> 
    folder.</li>
  <li>Open the <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file and make a note of the password
  that is defined for the "ide" username.</li>
</ol>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      
    <td><img src="../../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
	 The username and password are <b>not</b> saved when you enter them
	 in this dialog box. The username and password are only saved if
	 you define them in the Tomcat Web Server's Properties dialog box. 
	 To open the Properties dialog box, right-click the Tomcat Web Server's 
	 instance node in the Services window and select
	 Properties.
