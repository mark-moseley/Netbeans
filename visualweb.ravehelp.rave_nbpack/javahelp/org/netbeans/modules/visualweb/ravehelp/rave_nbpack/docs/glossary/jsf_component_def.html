<h4>JSF (JavaServer Faces) component</h4>
<p>A software component that you can use in building the user interfaces of your 
  web applications. The component can be either visual, such as a button or a 
  drop-down, or nonvisual, such as a data validator or converter. JavaServer Faces technology 
  enables you to assemble these UI components in a page, connect the components 
  to a database or web service, and wire client-generated events to server-side 
  event handlers. A user interface created with JavaServer Faces technology can handle all 
  the complexities of user interface management, including input validation, component-state 
  management, navigation, and event handling.</p>
