       About Visual Web JSF Components
    </h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
       Components are reusable user interface elements that you can use to build the visual
      interface for your page. Components are rendered into HTML page elements such as text,
      hyperlinks, or form elements. The components in the IDE are based on JavaServer Faces
      technology and use JavaScript.
    </p>
    <ul class="note">
      <li>
        Because these components use JavaScript, users of your web applications must have
        JavaScript enabled in their web browsers. In addition, users of your applications must
        enable cookies and CSS in their web browsers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Components have properties, which describe the appearance, state, or other features of a
      specific component on a page. You can edit properties by <a href=
      "howtocomponents/set_comp_props.html">using the Properties window</a>, or you can <a href=
      "howtocomponents/bind_comp_props.html">bind properties</a> to values contained in other
      components or services such as databases or web services.
    </p>
    <p>
       By default, components that you add to a Visual Web JSF page are arranged on the page by position: Where
      you place them in the Visual Designer is where they will appear on the final HTML page. You
      can <a href="howtocomponents/layer_comp.html">stack components</a> on top of each other using
      the Bring to Front and Send to Back menu items, and you can <a href=
      "howtocomponents/nest_comp.html">nest components</a> together using the Grid Panel and Group
      Panel components.
    </p>
    <p>
       Finally, components can have associated event handlers, written in the Java language, that
      are executed when the page is submitted.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Component Categories
    </h3>
  <p>
       Components are located in the <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="../ui_elements/palette/palette_win_graphic.html">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="300,515">
        <param name="text" value="Components view of the Palette"></object> 
     &nbsp;and are grouped under categories. Click a category in the Components view to
      see the associated components.    </p>
    <p>
       The Components view contains the following categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>(Woodstock)</strong>        <b>Basic</b>. The components that you are likely to use most often, like buttons, tables,
        drop down lists, and text fields, to name only a few.      </li>
      <li>
        <b>(Woodstock) Layout.</b> Components whose main purpose is organizing or formatting a page, like the
        Grid Panel component that arranges components in a grid or the Group Panel component that
        groups components together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>(Woodstock) Composite.</b> Components with a more complex organization and a specialized purpose,
        like the Add Remove List component that displays a list of items and lets the user add them
        to another list, or the Breadcrumbs component that displays a list of hyperlinks to
        previous pages in a site hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Validators.</b> A set of value checkers that you can use to validate user entered data.
      </li>
      <li>
      <b>Converters.</b> A set of data converters that you can use with components to convert
      between the <code>String</code> data type and other data types as needed. </li>
      <li>
        <b>Standard.</b> The original set of standard JavaServer Faces components that
        shipped with the IDE. They are not as sophisticated or easy to use as the Basic, Layout,
        and Composite components. For example, the Standard components cannot participate in a
        theme, and their structure is often more complex to work with than the Basic components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Advanced.</b> A set of JavaServer Page markup tags for advanced users. The components
        have no visual appearance and are useful to developers with experience in JSP and
        JavaServer Faces technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Data Providers.</b> A set of components that provide an interface to data sources like
        database tables and JavaBeans objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Advanced Data Providers.</b> A set of data providers for use by advanced users only.
        These data providers are typically created for you and do not need to be added separately.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       Viewing and Managing Components
    </h3>
    <p>
       You can view or manage components in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the 
 to <object classid=
      "java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer">
        <param name="content" value="../ui_elements/palette/palette_win_graphic.html">
        <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
        <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
        <param name="viewerSize" value="300,515">
        <param name="text" value="Components view of the Palette"></object>
 drag components into
        the Visual Designer to work with them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the <object classid=java:com.sun.java.help.impl.JHSecondaryViewer>
    <param name="content" value="../ui_elements/navigator_win/navigator_win_popup.html">
    <param name="viewerActivator" value="javax.help.LinkLabel">
    <param name="viewerStyle" value="javax.help.Popup">
    <param name="viewerSize" value="385,450">
    <param name="text" value="Navigator window"></object>
 to
        view a hierarchical list of the components on a page. If you select a component in the
        Navigator window, the component is selected in the Visual Designer and vice versa. You can
        sometimes select a component more easily in the Navigator window than in the Visual Designer,
        especially if you want to change its location in a hierarchy of subcomponents. You can
        right-click a component's node in the Navigator window and select the same pop-up menu items
        as in the Visual Designer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="note">
  <li><b>Note: </b>NetBeans IDE 6.1 features on-demand binding. If you plan to scrip the component in Java code, you must manually add a binding attribute to the component. To do so, right-click the component and choose Add Binding Attribute.</li>
