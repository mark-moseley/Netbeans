<h2>Visual Web JSF Project Properties: Sources Category </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Sources panel of the Project Properties dialog box enables you to view the 
project folder location, to manage source  folders, and to set the source/binary format of the packages that the IDE will use. You can open the Project Properties dialog box from the <a href="../../ui_elements/project_nav/projectlogical.html">Projects window</a> by right-clicking a project and choosing Properties.
  <!--explain source/binary format?-->
Then select Sources in the Categories list on the left side. </p>
<p>You can change the location of your web pages by clicking the Browse button next to the Web Pages Folder field.</p>
<p>Use the buttons on the right side of the Sources panel to add, remove, and change the order of packages. Choosing Add enables you to add an additional source root. You can have multiple source roots in a standard project, with the following exceptions: 

<ul class=tip>
  <li>The source root cannot already exist in another IDE project. </li>
  <li>The source root cannot already be added to another compilation unit of the 
  	same project. </li>
  <li>All  the source roots must be packaged into the same JAR file and share the 
  	same classpath. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a source root that you want to use with several projects, you 
  	must create a separate project for the source root and set up compilation 
	dependencies between the projects. </p>

<b>Setting the Source/Binary Format</b>

<p>You can use the Source/Binary Format combo box  
to set the lowest Java platform version with which the generated Java code should be 
compatible. This setting corresponds to the javac <tt>-source</tt> option. 
Setting the source/binary format helps prevent you from using Java language constructs 
that are not available in the platform version to which you want to deploy. 
However, setting the source/binary format does not ensure that the platform APIs 
are used compatibly with that platform version. To make sure that your application 
is fully compatible with an earlier Java platform version, you need to 
switch to the <a href="project_props_libraries.html">Libraries tab</a> 
and set the Java Platform setting to the minimum version on which you plan
to deploy.</p>
<UL class=note>
  <li>Specifying the source/binary format does not change the Java platform whose 
  	libraries and executables are used to compile and run your project. To 
	set the Java platform that is used for compiling and running your project, 
	click Libraries and set the Java Platform setting. You cannot set the source/binary format of a project to a higher release than the project's Java platform.</li>
