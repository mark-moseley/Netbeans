<h6>UDDI registry</h6>
<p>UDDI (Universal Discovery, Description, and Integration) registries contain 
  information about web services, including the location of WSDL files and the 
  location of the running services. You cannot publish web services to a UDDI 
  registry, in the IDE, although the WSDL files that you use to create web service 
  clients as well as the implementations of web services can come from a variety 
  of sources, including a UDDI registry. </p>
