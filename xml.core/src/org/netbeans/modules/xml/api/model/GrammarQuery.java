/**
 * A query interface returning possible fenomens as given by document grammar.
 * <p>
 * It provides at specified <code>HintContext</code> following information:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>allowed element names and namespaces
 *  <li>allowed entity names
 *  <li>allowed notation names
 *  <li>allowed attribute names
 *  <li>allowed values of attribute values or element content
 * </ul>
 * This information are returned as <code>Enumeration</code>. Every member of
 * the enumeration represents one possible option. Empty enumeration signals
 * that no hint can be derived from grammar in given context.
 * <p>
 * Every option represents DOM <code>Node</code> that can have children. These children
 * represents mandatory content for given option. Providing them is optional.
 * On the other hand <code>EMPTY</code> elements may not provide any children.
 *
 * <h3>Context Representation</h3>
 * Query context is represented by a read-only DOM1 model Core and XML modules
 * (it may be replaced with DOM2).
 * 
 * <h3>Implementation Note:</h3>
 * <p>
 * DOM1 does describe only non-DTD part of document. 
 * <p>
 * Passed context may represent errorous XML document. The code must
 * take into account that it can get <code>null</code>s even on places
 * where it does not expect it. E.g. <code>getParentNode()</code> as
 * the DOM document can be constructed as a <b>best effort</b> one.
 * <p>
 * Also as the context may originate from a text editor it is better to 
 * rely on <code>getPreviousSibling</code> rather then <code>getNextSibling</code>
 * as user usaully types text from document begining.
