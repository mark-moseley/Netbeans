 * Provider interface for webmodules.

 * project which owns a file (if any) and checks its lookup for this interface,

 * define the webmodule for files it owns, assuming it uses projects for 
 * implementation of webmodule.

 * <p> If needed a new implementation of this interface can be registered in 
 * global lookup.
