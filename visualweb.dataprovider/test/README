README for executing the CachedRowSetDataProvider tests

To run the tests:
1. Check-out NetBeans visualweb source and build.  See http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/VisualWebBuildInstructions (see instructions for visualweb).
   If visualweb/test was not checked out the also checkout

2. In your local workspace, copy visualweb/test/data/DefaultDatabase.properties.template to visualweb/test/data/DefaultDatabase.properties

3. Set the path to the location of the Java DB installation

4. Either use CachedRowSet_DataProvider_unit.sh or copy the command in the script and run from the commandline
   Make sure to set the BASE variable to the root of the NetBeans workspace 


If other databases are to be tested then create appropriate settings for the database.
See Database.properties.template

If you don't want to run the other dataprovider tests then in cfg-unit.xml, change <include name="**/*Test.class"/> from include to exclude
