IDS_IO_ALT=Designates that the CombinedFragment represents a choice of behavior.
IDS_IO_ELSE=Designates a guard that is the negation of the conjunction of all other guards in the enclosing CombinedFragment.
IDS_IO_OPT=Designates that the CombinedFragment represents a choice of behavior where either the (sole) operand happens or nothing happens.
IDS_IO_PAR=Designates that the CombinedFragment represents a parallel merge between the behaviors of the operands.
IDS_IO_LOOP=Designates that the CombinedFragment represents a loop.

IDS_Q_CREATE_CLASS_TITLE=Classifier not found
IDS_Q_CREATE_CLASS=The classifier specified for this element was not found.  Do you want to add the classifier to the current project?
IDS_Q_INVOKED_OPERATION_TITLE=Moving Message with Invoked Operation
IDS_Q_INVOKED_OPERATION=The message being moved has an invoked operation. Do you want to move the operation from the original representing classifier to the new representing classifier?\n\nClick Yes to move the operation to the new classifier, No to copy the operation to the new representing classifier or Cancel to make no changes.
IDS_NAME_CLASSIFIER_TITLE=Unknown Classifier
IDS_NAME_CLASSIFIER=You are changing the alias of a lifeline which does not have a representing classifier. Please\nselect a representing classifier from the list of available elements. To create a new element, type\nthe name below.
