<h2>Layout Properties Sheet: Routing Tab</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Routing tab of the Layout property sheet lets you specify options for a diagram. The routing algorithm routes edges to run parallel to the x-axis and the y-axis. When edge crossings occur, the algorithm ensures that the edges involved can still be clearly read.</p>
<p>You can use the following options to fine-tune routing.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Edge Spacing.</b> The settings for horizontal and vertical edge spacing determine the minimum distance between any two neighboring parallel edges. Edge spacing settings can also affect the size of a node to which many edges are attached, unless the node is set to remain fixed at its current size. The settings for edge spacing are constant values.</li>
<li><b>Attaching to Nodes.</b> You can specify on which side or sides to attach each edge to its source node and target node. You can also specify for each node which side to attach its edges. For example, you can specify that the node&rsquo;s edges attach to the left or right side. If this specification conflicts with the side specified for the edge, the edge setting takes precedence.</li>
<li><b>Node Positioning.</b> For each node, you can specify whether it can be moved. The movement is minimal to avoid overlaps and minimize bend points. This option is only available if repositioning nodes is enabled. If repositioning nodes is disabled, the per node setting is ignored.</li>
<li><b>Node Sizing.</b> The routing algorithm does not reduce node sizes. However, it can increase a node&rsquo;s size when more than one edge is attached to the same side of the node and it needs to maintain the specified edge spacing.<br>
For each node, you can specify whether it can be enlarged. This option is only available if enlarging nodes is enabled. If you prevent nodes from resizing, you might get edge spacing smaller than you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table describes these options in more detail.</p>
