<title>Filtering Element Types From the Projects Window (UML Modeling)</title>

<h2>Filtering Element Types From the Projects Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can temporarily hide element nodes in the Projects window. For example, if your expanded project tree contains many Actors that you do not need to see at the moment, you can save space by filtering out Actor nodes. Or, if you want to flatten the appearance of your project tree, you can filter out Package nodes. You can select more than one element type to filter out. </p>
<ul class="note">
<li>After you apply a filter to the Projects window, all element types still appear in the Diagram editor and other windows.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To filter out element types:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window, open a project, right-click the Model node, and choose Filter.<br>
The Filter dialog box appears.</li>
<li>Expand the Model Elements node and select the element types that you want to filter out.<br>
A checkmark indicates that the element type will not be filtered out. When you click an element type, the checkmark disappears. When you click the element type again, the checkmark appears.</li>
<li>Click OK.<br>
The IDE applies your filter to the Projects window. The Projects window now displays all element types, except the ones you selected to be filtered out.</li>
</ol>
