<h2>Sharing Patterns</h2>
<p>After creating your own pattern to solve a specific software development problem, you might want to share the pattern with other users. </p>
<p>First, if you have not already done so, <a href="promoting_patterns_to_design_center.html">promote your user-defined pattern</a> to the UML Design Center. After that step, sharing the pattern is as easy as copying a folder to another filesystem or computer. </p>
<p><b>To share your pattern with other users:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the UML Design Center window, select a project to share.</li>
<li>In the Properties window, locate the folder containing the project by selecting the File Name property.</li>
<li>Copy the entire folder to the target location.</li>
<li>At the target location, <a href="inserting_removing_projects.html">insert the project</a> into the UML Design Center window.</li>
<li>Be sure to save the design pattern catalog. To do so, right-click the DesignPatternCatalog node and select Save.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are ready to apply the pattern. See <a href="applying_patterns.html">Applying Patterns</a> for more details.</p>
