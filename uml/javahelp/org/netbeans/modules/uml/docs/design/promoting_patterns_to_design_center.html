<h2>Promoting Patterns to the UML Design Center</h2>
<p>If you want to apply a design pattern to multiple projects, the pattern must be in the design pattern catalog located in the <a href="using_design_center.html">open UML Design Center window</a>. </p>
<p><b>To promote a pattern from a project in the Projects window to the UML Design Center:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the user-defined project to which you want to add the pattern. For details, see <a href="creating_user_defined_projects.html">Creating User-Defined Projects</a>.</li>
<li>In the Projects window,  find the pattern that you want to promote.</li>
<li>Right-click the pattern and choose Promote Design Pattern.<br>
The Promote Pattern to Design Center dialog box appears.</li>
<li>From the Project list, select the project in the UML Design Center in which the pattern will be placed.</li>
<li>If desired, select a package from the Namespace drop-down list.</li>
<li>To remove the pattern from the project in the Projects window, select the Remove From Current Project checkbox.<br>
The pattern is removed from the Projects window and placed in the UML Design Center. If you don't select this option, the pattern is copied to the UML Design Center, but it also remains in the Projects window.</li>
</ol>
