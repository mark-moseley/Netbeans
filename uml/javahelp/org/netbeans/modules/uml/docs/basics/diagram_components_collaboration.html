<h2>Collaboration Diagram Elements</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The following table describes the elements that you can add to Collaboration diagrams. The elements are grouped by <a href="palette.html">Modeling Palette</a> section.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Element</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Icon</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Basic Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Lifeline</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/collaboration-lifeline.png"></td>
<td>An individual participant in the Interaction. While Parts and structural features may have multiplicity greater than one, Lifelines represent only one interacting entity.
<ul class="note">
<li>To re-order Lifelines, simply drag a timeline to a new location.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Actor</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/actor.png"></td>
<td>A role played by users in your system.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Connector</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/connector.png"></td>
<td>A specified link that enables communication between two or more instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Dependencies Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Dependency</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/dependency.png"></td>
<td>The relationship between two elements whose definitions depend on one another in such a way that changes to one can result in changes to the other. For example, when one class mentions another as an operation parameter, or as part of its data, the two classes exhibit dependency.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Realize</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/realize.png"></td>
<td>A semantic relationship between classifiers - one classifier specifies a contract that another classifier guarantees to carry out. These relationships are used in two places: between interfaces and the classes that realize them, and between use cases and the collaboration that realize them.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Usage</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/usage.png"></td>
<td>A dependency in which one element (the client) requires the presence of another element (the supplier) for its correct functioning or implementation. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Permission</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/permission.png"></td>
<td>A dependency that signifies granting of access rights from the supplier model element to a client model element, in which the client requires access to some or all of the constituent elements of the supplier.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Abstraction</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/abstraction.png"></td>
<td>A boundary relative to the perspective of the viewer. The essential characteristics of an entity that distinguish it from all other kinds of entities. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Comments Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Comment</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/notepad.png"></td>
<td>A Notepad notation. Use Comments to record information for a element or link in a diagram. This information is not included in generated code but is for information only. Each Comment can contain unlimited text, and be numbered. You can also define a stereotype, and enter a noted element.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Link Comment</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/note-link.png"></td>
<td>The connection between the comment element and the associated element.</td>
</tr>
