<p>The following table describes the elements that you can add to Component diagrams. The elements are grouped by <a href="palette.html">Modeling Palette</a> section.</p>

<td><img src="../images/resources/images/generalization.png"></td>

</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Dependency</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/dependency.png"></td>
<td>The relationship between two elements whose definitions depend on one another in such a way that changes to one can result in changes to the other. For example, when one class mentions another as an operation parameter, or as part of its data, the two classes exhibit dependency.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Realize</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/realize.png"></td>
<td>A semantic relationship between classifiers - one classifier specifies a contract that another classifier guarantees to carry out. These relationships are used in two places: between interfaces and the classes that realize them, and between use cases and the collaboration that realize them.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Usage</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/usage.png"></td>
<td>A dependency in which one element (the client) requires the presence of another element (the supplier) for its correct functioning or implementation. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Permission</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/permission.png"></td>
<td>A dependency that signifies granting of access rights from the supplier model element to a client model element, in which the client requires access to some or all of the constituent elements of the supplier.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Abstraction</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/abstraction.png"></td>
<td>A boundary relative to the perspective of the viewer. The essential characteristics of an entity that distinguish it from all other kinds of entities. </td>

</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Template Class </td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/template-class.png"></td>
<td>An abstract class that is commonly used to define a collection type of object. Template Class contains the same information as a Class, but requires an attached Template Parameter Label. It provides the names and possible type of the parameters used by the Template.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Derivation Classifier </td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/derivation-classifier.png"></td>
<td>A classifier that can be computed from a Class, but that is shown for clarity or that is included for design purposes.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Derivation Edge</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/derivation-edge.png"></td>
<td>An association in which the owning classifier is a derivation of the template classifier of the derivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Association Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Association</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/association.png"></td>
<td>An association relationship between two elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Composition</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/composition.png"></td>

<td><img src="../images/resources/images/navigable-composition.png"></td>

<td><img src="../images/resources/images/aggregation.png"></td>

</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Association Class</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/class-association.png"></td>
<td>Denotes class information (attributes, operation, etc) about a specific association shared by two elements.</td>
