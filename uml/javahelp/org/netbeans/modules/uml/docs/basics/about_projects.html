<h2>About Projects</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A UML Modeling project (also called a UML project) is the mechanism by which you store and manage a collection of files for a UML model. A UML project contains all of the model's diagrams, their associated elements, any source code files, and metadata related to your UML model. </p>
<h3>Development Models</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Forward Engineering From Scratch.</b> If you only want to create a UML model, and plan to add implementation details such as code generation and completion later, you can use the <a href="../tasks_projects/creating_project.html#model_plaform_independent">Platform-Independent Model</a> or the <a href="../tasks_projects/creating_project.html#model_java_plaform">Java-Platform Model</a> in the New Project wizard.</li>
<li><b>Reverse-Engineering a Model From Existing Code.</b> If you have existing application code and want to reverse-engineer a UML model, you will be asked to specify the location of the existing code when you select <a href="../tasks_projects/creating_project.html#model_java_platform_rev_eng">Reverse Engineer a Java Project</a> in the New Project wizard.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project Nodes and Elements</h3>
<p>The <a href=nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/project/csh/proj_project_window.html">Projects window</a> displays a node for each UML project and its associated Java project. Associated UML and Java projects do not necessarily appear together in the window, so when you work with a project, be sure it is the one you intend. The UML project's subordinate nodes correspond to the diagrams in the project and the elements of each diagram. The IDE lets you open and work with several projects at a time.</p>
<p>You can share or reuse modeling elements between different UML diagrams and projects. UML Modeling lets you drag and drop an element from one diagram to another, reference an element from another diagram or project, or import an element into a project.</p>
<p>Using pop-up menus on nodes in the Projects window, you can do many of the same actions on UML diagrams and elements that you can do elsewhere in the IDE, for example, adding a modeling element to a diagram. </p>
<p>When you create a project, it is stored outside the IDE in a filesystem that you specify. To free up window space, you can close and reopen projects in the Projects window, or you can <a href="../editors_windows/filtering_element_types_from_projects_window.html">temporarily filter out modeling element types</a>. </p>
