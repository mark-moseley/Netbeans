<h2>Deployment Diagram Elements</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The following table describes the elements that you can add to Deployment diagrams. The elements are grouped by <a href="palette.html">Modeling Palette</a> section.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Element</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Icon</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Basic Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Component</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/component.png"></td>
<td>A physical and replaceable part of a system that conforms to and provides the realization of a set of interfaces.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Interface</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/interface.png"></td>
<td>A stereotype of class offering only public operations, but no attributes or method bodies.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Package</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/dt-package.png"></td>
<td>A grouping of class definitions.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Artifact</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/artifact.png"></td>
<td>A physical piece of information that is used or produced by a software development process, may include models, source files, scripts, and binary executables.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Node</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/node.png"></td>
<td>A classifier that represents a run-time computational resource, which generally has at least a memory and often processing capability. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Deployment Specification</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/deployment-spec.png"></td>
<td>A set of properties which determine execution parameters of a element artifact that is deployed on a node.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Generalization</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/generalization.png"></td>
<td>The relationship between a subtype element and a supertype element. The elements in this relationship must possess the same attributes. For example, the subtype Manager and the supertype Employee share a generalization relationship.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Implementation</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/implementation.png"></td>
<td>An implementation relationship between two elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Association</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/association.png"></td>
<td>An association relationship between two elements.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Dependencies Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Dependency</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/dependency.png"></td>
<td>The relationship between two elements whose definitions depend on one another in such a way that changes to one can result in changes to the other. For example, when one class mentions another as an operation parameter, or as part of its data, the two classes exhibit dependency.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Realize</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/realize.png"></td>
<td>A semantic relationship between classifiers.  One classifier specifies a contract that another classifier guarantees to carry out. These relationships are used in two places: between interfaces and the classes that realize them, and between use cases and the collaboration that realize them.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Usage</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/usage.png"></td>
<td>A dependency in which one element (the client) requires the presence of another element (the supplier) for its correct functioning or implementation. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Permission</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/permission.png"></td>
<td>A dependency that signifies granting of access rights from the supplier model element to a client model element, in which the client requires access to some or all of the constituent elements of the supplier.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Abstraction</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/abstraction.png"></td>
<td>A  boundary relative to the perspective of the viewer. The essential characteristics of an entity that distinguish it from all other kinds of entities. </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<th colspan="3" scope="col" align="left">Comments Section</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Comment</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/notepad.png"></td>
<td>A Notepad notation. Use Comments to record information for a element or link in a diagram. This information is not included in generated code but is for information only. Each Comment can contain unlimited text, and be numbered. You can also define a stereotype, and enter a noted element.</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>Link Comment</td>
<td><img src="../images/resources/images/note-link.png"></td>
<td>The connection between the comment element and the associated element.</td>
</tr>
