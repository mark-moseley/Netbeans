<h2>Generating Code</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The IDE's UML Modeling feature enables you to develop software incrementally, starting either from a new design or from an existing body of code. You can quickly generate source code for classes and interfaces using a pop-up menu in the Projects window or in the Diagram editor. </p>
<p><b>To generate code:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Projects window or in the Diagram editor, right-click the UML Modeling element or elements for which you want to generate code.
  <ul class="note">
<li>In the Projects window, this code generation function is supported for entire UML Modeling projects and for individual diagram elements. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From the pop-up menu, choose Generate Code.<br>
  You can also access the Generate Code dialog by right-clicking on the UML project node in the Projects window, selecting Properties from the pop-up menu, and then selecting the Code Generation category node in the Project Properties dialog.</li>
<li>In the Generate Code dialog, specify the following settings:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Target Project.</b> Select the target project to which the generated code will be associated.</li>
  <li><b>Source Root.</b> Specify which package folder location  to store the generated source files. </li>
  <li><b>Backup Existing Source Files.</b> If selected, the code generation process creates backup copies of the existing version of source files that are about to be generated. If not selected, backups are not created and only changes to the sources are merged into the affected source files.<br>
      An existing source file will be saved to a similarly named file with a number appended to its file name. For example, a source file named <i>sample.java</i> 
       will be saved to a file named <i>sample.java1. </i> On the next backup request, <i>sample.java</i> will be saved to <i>sample.java2</i>, and so on. The most recent backup file is the file with the highest sequential number at the end of its filename.</li>
   <li><b>Generate Markers for Source File Merging.</b> If selected, specifies that code be annotated with special code generation merge markers so that further code generation for the sources can be intelligently merged with existing code. Keep this option enabled until you are confident that you are finished modeling and you would like to generate the sources without the markers, if desired.

Attributes and operations that do not have any markers are ignored by the generate code process. </li>
   <li><b>Add Merge Markers to Existing Source Elements.</b> If selected, merge markers for existing attributes and operations are created in the existing source files. </li>
   <li><b>Prompt Before Generating Code. </b>If selected, the Generate Code dialog is prompted every time the Generate Code action is invoked. This is the default action and  provides you with the chance to change the generate code options (backup, merge markers or active templates) or to cancel out of the action before any sources are updated. Some may prefer to set the options once and never be prompted again. Disabling this option will prevent the dialog from displaying with each Generate Code execution.</li>
   <li><b>Templates</b> Displays a list of available domain template categories.    Under each category is a list of the
domain templates in summarized form (name, description, element type
and stereotype) with a check box that allows you to activate the domain
template. When activated, the domain template will be used for matching
elements in the project when the <i>Generate Code</i> action is invoked. At least one domain template must be activated for the generate code process to be executed. Hide Templates  hides the list of available templates. Show Templates displays that list. </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Click OK.<br>
  The Java Source code is generated for the selected element or elements. </li>
<li>If the Authorize UML Project Save dialog appears, you have some unsaved changes in your UML modeling project. Click one of the following buttons to continue with the code generation process. <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Yes. </b>Save the changes in the UML project before generating code.</li>
      <li><b>No.</b> Do not save the changes before generating code.</li>
      <li><b>Yes to All. </b>Always save the changes in the UML project before generating code during the current IDE session.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  The IDE generates the source code for target elements .<br>
  </li>
