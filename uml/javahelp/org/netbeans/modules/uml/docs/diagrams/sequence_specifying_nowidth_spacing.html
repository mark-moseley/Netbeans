<h2>Specifying No Width Spacing Restrictions</h2>
<p>When you want to move any two restricted Sequence diagram lifelines freely around their diagram, you can remove any spacing restrictions between them by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of the Sequence diagram, between the target lifelines, right-click the gray bar, and then choose No Width Restrictions. Make sure you have selected the two lifelines. <br>
The IDE removes any existing restriction, and removes any displays restriction indicator from the gray bar.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li>To re-order Lifelines, simply drag a timeline to a new location.</li>
</ul>
