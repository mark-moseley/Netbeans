<h2>Working With Nodes and Associations</h2>
<p>Deployment diagrams are useful in showing high-level configuration of run-time processing and the software components, processes, and objects. Software component instances represent run-time manifestations of code units, and associations between nodes permit the exchange of signals and messages. You can work with nodes and associations as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="deployment_adding_nodes.html">Add Nodes</a></li>
<li><a href="deployment_naming_nodes.html">Name Nodes</a></li>
<li><a href="deployment_connecting_nodes.html">Connect Nodes</a></li>
