<h2>Working With Element Spacing Restrictions</h2>
<p>You can restrict the positioning of Sequence diagram lifelines so that you can space your diagrams without overlapping or crowding certain diagram areas. When you apply a restriction, you can <a href="sequence_showing_hiding_indicators.html">show or hide</a> its correlating indicator in the gray bar on the top of the target Sequence diagram to remind you of the type of restriction. All work with restrictions is performed in this gray bar. The list below describes the spacing restrictions you can apply to Sequence diagrams.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="sequence_specifying_nowidth_spacing.html">No Width Restrictions</a>. Lets you move any lifeline as close to an adjacent lifeline as needed, pushing adjacent lifelines out of the way when both make contact.</li>
<li><a href="sequence_specifying_retainminwidth_spacing.html">Retain Minimum Width</a>. Lets you move the target lifeline no closer than the current distance from its adjacent lifeline. This restriction is indicated in the gray bar by a straight line with straight, vertical ends. </li>
<li><a href="sequence_specifying_messagewidth_spacing.html">Set Width to Message Width</a>. Lets you move the target lifeline no closer than the current distance from its adjacent lifeline. This distance automatically expands when one of the target lifelines is moved further away from its counterpart. This restriction is indicated in the gray bar by a straight line with curved, vertical ends.</li>
</ul>
