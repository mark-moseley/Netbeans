<title>Pasting Elements (UML Modeling)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Pasting Elements</h2>
<p>You can paste any cut or copied UML Diagram window component into a Diagram window, into selected third-party applications, or into an HTML document. When you cut or copy a component, the IDE removes it from the window and places it on a clipboard for you to paste. The copied item remains on the clipboard until you cut or copy another selection. You can paste a component from the clipboard as many times as you want.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>Because the IDE automatically pastes copied graphics into third-party applications, you do not need to export images from the IDE or import them into these applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To paste a component that you have cut or copied to the clipboard:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the destination Diagram window, choose the target location.</li>
<li>Right-click the background of the destination window, and, under Edit, choose Paste.<br>
The IDE pastes the component in the target location.</li>
<li>To paste the component outside the IDE in a destination application, choose the target location, and then press Ctrl-V.<br>
The IDE pastes the component in the target location.</li>
</ol>
