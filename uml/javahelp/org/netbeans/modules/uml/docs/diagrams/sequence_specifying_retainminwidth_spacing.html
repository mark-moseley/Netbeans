<h2>Specifying the Retain Minimum Width Spacing Restriction</h2>
<p>When you want to restrict the mobility of any two Sequence diagram lifelines such that they can be moved no closer to each other, you can specify a minimum width space between the target lifelines by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of the Sequence diagram, between the target lifelines, right-click the gray bar, and then choose Retain This Minimum Width. Make sure you have selected the two lifelines. <br>
The IDE applies the restriction, and displays between the target lifelines a straight line with straight, vertical ends.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li>To re-order Lifelines, simply drag a timeline to a new location.</li>
</ul>
