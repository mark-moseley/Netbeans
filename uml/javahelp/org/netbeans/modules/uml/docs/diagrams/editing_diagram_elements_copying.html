<title>Copying Elements (UML Modeling)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Copying Elements</h2>
<p>You can copy any UML modeling element that is displayed in the Diagram editor. When you copy an element, the IDE removes it from the window and places it on a clipboard. You can then <a href="editing_diagram_elements_pasting.html">paste</a> the copied element into the same diagram or a different diagram that is open in the Diagram editor, or into selected third-party applications like Microsoft Word. The copied element remains on the clipboard until you cut or copy another selection.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>The IDE fully utilizes the Microsoft Windows copy buffer, which means you can copy elements from any UML model and place them in Microsoft applications. Because the IDE automatically pastes copied graphics into third-party applications, you do not need to export images from the IDE's UML Modeling feature for import into these applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To copy and paste an element:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the UML modeling element and choose Edit Copy.<br>
The IDE copies the element to a clipboard for pasting.</li>
<li>Right-click in the destination file and choose Edit Paste. <br>
A Paste symbol appears.</li>
<li>Position the Paste symbol and click once. <br>
The element you pasted appears in the target diagram or application. </li>
</ol>
