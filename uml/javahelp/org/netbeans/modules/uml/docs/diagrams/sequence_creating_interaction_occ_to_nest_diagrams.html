<title>Creating an Interaction Occurrence to Nest Sequence Diagrams (UML Modeling)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Creating an Interaction Occurrence to Nest Sequence Diagrams</h2>
<p>You can nest Sequence diagrams within other Sequence diagrams. The UML 2.0 specification refers to any nested Sequence diagram as an interaction occurrence. </p>
<p>When you nest one Sequence diagram inside another, the Diagram editor shows the resulting interaction occurrence as a combined fragment element inside the destination diagram. This combined fragment element has the following labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside the element: the name of the nested Sequence diagram</li>
<li>In the element's tab: the interaction operator <tt>ref</tt> </li>
</ul>
<p>In the Projects window, a node for the interaction occurrence appears under the node for the destination Sequence diagram.</p>
<p><b>To nest one Sequence diagram inside another and create an interaction occurrence in the destination diagram:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Diagram editor, have the destination diagram open. </li>
<li>In the Projects window, expand the nodes for both of the Sequence diagrams: the target diagram (which you will drag) and the destination diagram (in which you will nest the target diagram).</li>
<li>In the Projects window, select the top node for the target diagram.</li>
<li>Drag the node into the destination diagram in the Diagram editor.<br>
    The IDE creates a combined fragment element in the destination diagram. Notice how the element is represented in the Diagram editor and in the Projects window. </li>
</ol>
