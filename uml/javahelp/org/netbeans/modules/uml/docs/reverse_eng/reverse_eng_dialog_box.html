<title>Reverse Engineer Dialog Box (UML Modeling)</title>

<h2>Reverse Engineer Dialog Box </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Reverse Engineer dialog box lets you reverse-engineer existing Java source code into a UML Modeling project that contains 100% of the code's structural information, except comments and white space. <br>
  <br>
You access this dialog box by  right-clicking the Java source project node, a Java class node, or multiple Java class nodes  in the Projects window and choosing Reverse Engineer from the pop-up menu. You can also invoke this dialog box by right-clicking in the Java source editor and choosing Reverse Engineer from the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>This dialog box has the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Selected Nodes.</b> Read-only field that lists the project elements that were selected to be reverse-engineered in the Projects window.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Use Existing UML Project.</b> Select this option if you want to use an existing UML Modeling project to store the  elements generated by the current reverse-engineering process.
    <ul>
  <li><b>Target Project.</b> From the pull-down menu, choose the UML project you want to use as the target for the reverse-engineering elements. Only UML projects currently opened in the Projects window will appear in the pull-down selection.</li>
  </ul>  
  <p>If you use an existing UML project, the Model Element Overwrite Authorization dialog box appears during the reverse-engineering process. This dialog box lists the model elements that will be overwritten and asks for your confirmation. The authorization dialog box has the following buttons:
   <ul>
  <li><b>Yes. </b>Overwrites the current element and the reverse-engineering process continues.</li>
  <li><b>No. </b>The current element is not overwritten and the reverse-engineering process continues.</li>
  <li><b>Yes to All. </b>The current element and all other elements that have name conflicts during the current reverse-engineering process are overwritten.</li>
  <li><b>No to All. </b>The current element and all other elements that have name conflicts during the current reverse-engineering process are not overwritten. This allows the user to reverse engineer new Java sources that have been added to the Java project without overwriting  any of the existing Java source elements that were previously reverse-engineered. </li>
  <li><b>Cancel.</b> Aborts the current reverse-engineering process. Any reverse-engineer processing that has been completed prior to the Cancel is <b>not</b> undone. <br>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Create New UML Project.</b> Select this option to create a new UML project to store the elements generated by the reverse engineering process.
    <ul>
  		<li><b>Project Name. </b> Specify the display name you want to give the new UML project. This name is also used to create the project folder. </li>
		<li><b>Project Location.</b> Specify the location  in which to store the project folder containing the reverse-engineered elements. You can use the Browse button to select the  project location.</li>
		<li><b>Project Folder. </b>This read-only field lists the value of the folder where  the new UML project files and reverse-engineered elements will be stored. The folder is a concatenation of the project location  and the project name specified above this field. </li>
  </ul></li>
