<title>Associating a DOORS Requirements Project to UML Modeling Elements (UML Modeling)</title>

<h2>Associating a DOORS Requirements Project to UML Modeling Elements</h2>
<p>Before you can associate a DOORS requirements project to  UML modeling elements, you must first run the script to  integrate support for the DOORS tool. For steps to run the script, see <a href="integrating_doors_tool.html">Integrating Support for the DOORS Tool</a>. </p>
<p><b>To associate a DOORS requirements project to UML Modeling elements:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the UML Design Center window, right-click a Requirements node and choose Add Requirement Source.<br>
The Requirements Provider dialog box opens.</li>
<li>In the Requirements Provider dialog box, select DOORS Requirements Provider, and then click Open.<br>
The DOOR Projects dialog box displays all available DOORS projects that can be brought into the Design Center Requirements node.</li>
<li>In the DOOR Projects dialog box, select a Project, and then click OK.<br>
The IDE populates the requirements node with the DOORS project.
<ul class="note">
<li>To see all existing requirements and sub-requirements, expand the node. You can now drag any requirement onto any diagram modeling elements. When a requirement is associated with a modeling element, it is listed under the Satisfiers node. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>To remove a Satisfier, right-click the target Satisfier, and then click Remove Satisfier.</li>
<li>In DOORS, open the Format Module that you have associated with UML Modeling so that you can add, delete, and modify requirements.</li>
<li>When you have finished adding, deleting, or modifying requirements in DOORS, go back to UML Modeling. On the requirement projects node, click Refresh.<br>
The IDE updates the requirements.
<ul class="note">
<li>In the DOORS Project, you can see that the IDE's UML Modeling feature creates a matching module for every DOORS module associated with a UML Modeling element. This UML Modeling module exhibits all elements associated with DOORS requirements, and the associated DOORS requirements themselves. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
