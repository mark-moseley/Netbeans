<title>Using an XML File (UML Modeling)</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Using an XMLFile</h2>
<p>The IDE's UML Modeling feature lets you bring in requirements through an XML  file.</p>
<p>The IDE comes with a sample requirement file: <tt>Automated Teller Machine.etreq</tt> located in the following directory: &lt;<em>installdir</em>&gt;<tt>\netbeans-5.5\nb5.5\modules\DoorsIntegrationFiles\Samples</tt>.</p>
<p><b>To use an XML file to associate requirements with your UML Modeling elements:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the UML Design Center window, right-click a Requirements node and choose Add Requirement Source.<br>
The Requirements Provider dialog box opens.</li>
<li>In the Requirements Provider dialog box, select XML Requirements Source, and then click Open. </li>
<li>In the Open Requirements dialog box, navigate to and select the requirements file to associate with a UML Modeling Project.</li>
<li>Click Open.<br>
The IDE adds a node in the Design Center window under the Requirements node.<br>
You can see the description of each requirement in the Documentation window. These requirements are now available for association with UML Modeling elements.</li>
<li>To add a requirement, simply drag it onto modeling elements in the Diagram editor.<br>
The IDE adds a Satisfiers node under the requirement, showing the associated element.</li>
<li>To see the requirement, in the Open Projects, select the element that has the corresponding requirement attached.
If the Requirement node does not appear in the project tree, follow the instructions in <a href="../editors_windows/filtering_element_types_from_projects_window.html">Filtering Element Types From the Projects Window</a> to show RequirementArtifact elements.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>
