    <h2>Setting up a JMS Resource on the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>The JMS API allows loosely coupled, reliable, asynchronous interactions among Java EE components 
    and legacy systems capable of messaging. You can add new behavior 
    to a Java EE application that has existing business events by adding a new message-driven 
    bean to operate on specific business events. Java EE components that use the JMS API within EJB 
    or web containers must have no more than one JMS session per JMS connection. For more, see
    <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.j2ee.platform/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/platform/docs/ejb/general/about_msg_driven_beans.html">About Message-Driven Beans</a>.</p>
    <p>The JMS API uses two kinds of administered resource objects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Connection Factories</b> (Connector Resource). These objects are used to create a connection to the JMS messaging system, 
        and encapsulate connection parameters.</li>
        <li><b>Destination Resources</b> (Admin Object Resource). These objects are specified as the targets and sources of messages.
            When creating a destination resource, you create two objects:   
            <ul>
                <li>A physical destination</li>
                <li>A destination resource that refers to the physical destination using the JNDI name</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A JMS application normally uses at least one connection factory and at least one destination.
    The order in which the resources are created does not matter.</p>
    
    <p><b>To create a JMS resource:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to File &gt; New (Ctrl-N).</li>
        <li>In the Project drop-down list, choose either your EJB module or Web module.</li>
        <li>Select GlassFish in the Categories pane, JMS Resource in the File Types pane, and click Next.</li>
        <li>(required) Enter a JNDI name for the resource. JMS administered objects are usually placed within the <tt>jms</tt> naming subcontext (for example, <tt>jms/MyMessageSource</tt>).</li>
        <li>Enable or disable the resource by choosing true or false.</li>
        <li>Enter a description.</li>
        <li>To create a destination resource, choose one of the following admin object resource types:
            <ul>
                <li><tt><b>javax.jms.Queue</b></tt> - used for point-to-point communication</li>
                <li><tt><b>javax.jms.Topic</b></tt> - used for publish-subscribe communication</li>
            </ul>

            To create a connection factory, choose one of the following connector resource types:
            <ul>
                <li><tt><b>javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory</b></tt> - used for point-to-point communication</li>
                <li><tt><b>javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory</b></tt> - used for publish-subscribe communication</li>
                <li><tt><b>javax.jms.ConnectionFactory</b></tt> - used for point-to-point communication</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="note">
                <li>With the introduction of the JMS 1.1 specification, it is recommended that you use <tt>javax.jms.ConnectionFactory</tt>
            if you do not need to support existing code.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Click Next.</li>
        <li>Enter properties for the resource, if any.</li>
        <li>Click Finish.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>When you complete the wizard, the resource properties are added to <tt>sun-resources.xml</tt>.
    If you need to edit the properties of the resource, you can open <tt>sun-resources.xml</tt> in the Source Editor by expanding the 
    Server Resources node of your project in the Projects window and double-clicking the file. </p>

    <p>Once you have created the object in your project, the resource needs to be registered with the server before you can use it.
    The resource is automatically registered when you deploy your project.</p>
        
    <h3>Connector Resources</h3>
    <p>When you register JMS resources, the IDE automatically registers connector resources.
    A connector resource is a program object that provides an
    application with a connection to an EIS. Multiple connector resources
    may specify a single connection pool. Applications locate a connector
    resource by doing a look up of the resource using its JNDI name.</p>
    <p>When you create the JMS resources using the wizard, the IDE automatically performs the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For each JMS connection factory that you register, the IDE registers a connector connection pool and connector resource.</li> 
        <li>For each JMS destination you register, the IDE registers an admin object resource.</li>
        <!--<li>When you delete a JMS resources, the corresponding connector resources are automatically deleted.</li>-->
    </ul> 
    <p>Connector resources are visible in the Connectors node in the Services window.</p>
    <p>For more on these types of communication and other aspects of JMS,
    see the Chapter 32 The Java Message Service in the Java EE 5 Tutorial:</p>
