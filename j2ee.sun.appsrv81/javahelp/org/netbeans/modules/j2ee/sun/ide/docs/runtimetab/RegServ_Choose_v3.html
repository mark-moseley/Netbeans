        <h2>Add Server Instance Wizard: GlassFish v3 Server Location</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You see this page of the Add Server Instance wizard when you specify details to register an instance of GlassFish v3 with the IDE.
        To register a server instance, you specify the properties of a local or remote domain.</p>
        <p>Use this page to specify the following information about the location of GlassFish v3.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Installation Location.</strong> Supply the path to a local installation of GlassFish v3 server.
            Click Browse to navigate to the location of the local installation of the server.
            
            <p>If there is no installation of GlassFish v3 on your local system, you can download and install the
            GlassFish v3 server from the wizard by clicking the Download button.
            After you click Download, the IDE will install the current version of GlassFish v3.</p>

            <ul class="note"><li>You must accept the terms of the licensing agreement to enable the Download button.</li></ul>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>After you specify the location of the GlassFish v3 installation, click Next to specify the details of the
            local or remote domain.</p>
            <!--<li><b>Type of domain.</b> Select the type of domain to register.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Register Local Default Domain.</b> Select this type to register a domain located in the default domain folder of the platform you specify.
                    <p>Choose a domain from the list of accessible domains found in the default domain folder.</p>
                    <ul class="note"><li>When you install the server, the default domain folder containing a default domain is created in the local installation folder.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Register Local Domain.</b> Select this type to register a local domain located outside the default domain folder of the platform you specify.
                    If you select this type, you need to specify the location of the local domain.</li>
                    <li><b>Register Remote Domain.</b> Select this type to register a remote domain. 
                    If you select this type, you need to supply the host and communication port for the remote domain.
                    <ul class="note"><li>You cannot stop or start a remote server from within the IDE.</li></ul></li>
                    <li><b>Create Personal Domain.</b>
                    Select this type to create a new domain.
                    This option is only available if you are registering an instance of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish.
                    If you select this type, you need to specify where to create the new domain. 
                    Choosing this type enables you to specify port settings for the new domain.
                    You can also choose a profile type from the drop-down list.</li>
                    <li><b>Profile.</b>
                    If you are registering an instance of the Sun Java System Application Server 9.1.x/GlassFish v2.x,
                    when you create a personal domain you can choose a Profile type from the drop-down list.
                    If you are registering an earlier version of the application server, only the Default profile is available. 
                    <p>You choose a profile type according to how you intend to use the application server software.
                    The personal domain is created and configured based on the profile that you choose. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Default.</b> This domain is essentially the same as the Developer profile.</li>
                        <li><b>Developer.</b> This domain is configured to be run in a development environment. 
                        This configuration offers the advantage of faster server startup.</li>
                        <li><b>Cluster.</b> The domain is configured so that it can be used as part of a cluster of application server instances. </li>
                        <li><b>Enterprise.</b> The domain is configured to be used in a production environment for large-scale deployments. 
                        This profile offers greater security. This option requires that you have HADB installed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
