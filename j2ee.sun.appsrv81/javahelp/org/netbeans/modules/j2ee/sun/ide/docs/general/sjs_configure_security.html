<h1>Configuring Security Roles for the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish</h1>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>If you want to create secure areas of a web application, you need to configure the security roles by
        modifying the project's deployment descriptors.
        When configuring the security roles for your web application, you define your security roles in <tt>web.xml</tt>.</p>
    <p>If the target server for your application is the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish, you need 
    to edit <tt>sun-web.xml</tt> to map the security roles to the users and groups defined on 
    the server.
    You map security roles by adding a principal or group to a security role. 
    A security role can have more than one principal or group.
    You can use the IDE to help you edit <tt>sun-web.xml</tt> to map security roles.</p>
    

<p><b>To map security roles:</b></p>
 
 <ol>
<li>In the Projects window of the IDE, double-click <tt>sun-web.xml</tt> located in the Configuration Files directory of your web application project.</li>
<li>Click the Security tab in the visual editor.</li>
<li>Click Add Security Role Mapping to create a new security role.
<ul class="note"><li>The security roles are determined by the security roles defined in <tt>web.xml</tt>.
If <tt>web.xml</tt> already defines a security role, the role is listed in <tt>sun-web.xml</tt>.
For more on defining security roles in <tt>web.xml</tt>, see 
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.web.helpset/org/netbeans/modules/web/helpset/docs/web/csh/graphic_editor/dd_multiview_security_securityrolesNode.html"><tt>web.xml</tt> Visual Editor: Security Roles</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expand the security role node to view the properties of the security role.</li>
<li>Click Add Principal or Add Group to open the Add Principal or Add Group dialog box.</li>
<li>In the dialog box, enter the name of the principal or group to add to the selected security role.
The name of the principal or group must match a name specified on the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish.
 </ol>
 
<ul class="note"><li>The principals and groups specified in <tt>sun-web.xml</tt> must be valid for the
realm as configured on the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish.
For more on setting users and groups on the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish,
see <a href="sjs_manage_users.html">Managing Users for the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish</a>.</li></ul>
