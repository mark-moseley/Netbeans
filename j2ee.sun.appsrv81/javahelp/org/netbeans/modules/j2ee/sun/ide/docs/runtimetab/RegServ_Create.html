        <h2>Add Server Wizard: Enter Creation Properties for a New Application Server Instance</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p> 
        <p>You see this page of the Add Server Instance wizard when you are creating a new server instance and 
        have supplied the new instance name and location. This panel allows you to define port numbers required for 
        creating the new instance.</p>

        <p>Each port value can be set independently. You are free to change them to suit your operational environment.</p>

        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>All specified port numbers must be unique, and the ports specified cannot be in use by other applications.</li>
            <li>Other processes or services may already be using one of the ports  
            defined here.  If you cannot start the server instance, remove the instance and 
            create a new one, making sure that none of the ports are currently in use by any applicataions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you click Finish, the new instance is created on your disc and registered with the IDE.</p>
        <p>When the new instance is created, a confirmation message is displayed in the 
        Instance Creation Results tab in the Output window.</p>
