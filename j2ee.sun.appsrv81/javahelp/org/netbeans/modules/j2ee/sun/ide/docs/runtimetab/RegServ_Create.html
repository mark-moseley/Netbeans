        <h2>Add Server Wizard: Enter Creation Properties for a New Application Server Domain</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p> 
        <p>You see this page of the Add Server Instance wizard when you are creating a new personal domain and 
        have supplied the location and admin information for the domain.</p> 
        <p>Use this page to define the port numbers required for creating the new domain.</p>

        <p>Each port value can be set independently. You are free to change them to suit your operational environment.</p>

        <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the ports specified are not in use by other applications. 
            All specified port numbers must be unique. 
            If you know that any of the ports defined in this page are in use, change the port number to an available port.</li>
            <li>If you cannot start the server instance, remove the instance and 
            create a new one, making sure that none of the ports are currently in use by any applicataions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you click Finish, the new domain is created on your disc and the server instance is registered with the IDE.</p>
        <p>When the new domain is created, a confirmation message is displayed in the 
        Instance Creation Results tab in the Output window.</p>
