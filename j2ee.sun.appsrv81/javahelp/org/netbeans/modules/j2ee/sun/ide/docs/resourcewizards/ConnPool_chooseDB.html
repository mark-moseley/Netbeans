        <h2>New JDBC Connection Pool: Choose Database Connection</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You see this page of the New File wizard when you are defining a connection pool.
        On this page you name the connection pool and specify the database connection to use.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new connection pool:</b></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Provide a name for the JDBC connection pool. This name will be used when <a href="../general/def_jdbcresource.html">defining a JDBC resource</a>.</li>
        <li>Select one of the following database connection options: 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Extract from existing connection.</b> Choose this option if the database connection for the database you want to use already exists. 
                The drop-down list contains connections that have already been created.
                When you select this option, the configuration information, including the complete URL, user name, and password, is extracted 
                from the selected connection. To add a new connection to the list, see
                <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.db/org/netbeans/modules/db/docs/connectdb.html">Connecting to a Database</a>.</li>
                <li><b>New configuration using database.</b> If there
                is no suitable existing connection, you can select a driver from the list of databases with known JDBC drivers.
                If you would like to use a datasource that is not listed you need to first register the database driver with the IDE.
                To add to the list of drivers, see <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.db/org/netbeans/modules/db/docs/adddriver.html">Adding a New Driver</a>.
                <ul class="note">
                    <li>If you select this option you will need to provide the connection information in the next page.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>XA (Global Transaction).</b> Select the XA (Global Transaction) radio button if using XA transactions.</li>
        <li>Click Next to <a href="ConnPool_props.html">Add Connection Pool Properties</a>.</li>        
        </ul>
