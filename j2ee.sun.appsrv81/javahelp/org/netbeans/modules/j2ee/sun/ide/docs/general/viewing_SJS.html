    <p>In the Services window, each registered instance of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish is represented by a node under
    the Servers node in the Services window. The subnodes of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish instance node 
    represent the resources and applications that have been deployed to the server.</p>
    <p>The following table shows you how to use the nodes in the Services window to explore and work with the server instance.
    To delete a resource, locate and right-click the resource under the appropriate node and choose Delete Resource.</p>
