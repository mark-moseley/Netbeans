    <h2>Registering a Resource with the Sun Java System Application Server</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>Once you have created a resource object, it needs to be registered with the server. Once registered, the object
    is available to all the applications and resources.</p>
    <p>Resources are automatically 
    registered with the server when the project is deployed. Using the contextual menu in the IDE
    you can also register resources individually without deploying or redeploying the project.</p>

    <p>When you create a resource object for a project with the New File wizard, 
    the resource is added to the project and appears in two places:</p>
    <ul><li>In the Server Resources node in the Projects window.</li>
        <li>In the setup folder in the Files window.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>To register an individual resource through the contextual menu:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate the object in the Projects window or Files window.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the object and select Register.</li>
        <li>In the Java Message Service Resource Registration dialog box, 
        check to make sure the JNDI resource name and the server instance are correct.</li>
        <li>Click Register.</li>
        <li>Click Close when you get the registration successful message.</li>
    </ol> 
    <p>After the object is registered with the server it is visible in the Runtime window under the Servers node
    under the node corresponding to the type of resource. You can modify some of the properties of the resource 
    object by opening the properties window for the object.</p>
    
    <p><b>To delete a resource from the server:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate the object you wish to delete in the Runtime window.</li>
        <li>Right-click on the object and select Delete.</li>
    </ol> 
    <p>When you delete a resource from the server it is no longer visible in the Runtime window.</p>
    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>    
    <ul>
        <li>After a resource has been removed from the server, it is still listed as a resource in your project.
        Unless you delete the resource from your project, when you deploy your application
        the resource will be registered again. To completely delete the resource and ensure that it is not
        registered again, delete the resource using the pop-up menu in the Files window or the Projects window.</li>
    
    
        <li>The JNDI name for a resource must be unique. If the JNDI name is already taken by another resource,
        an error message will appear in the dialog box when you try to register the resource. To change the JNDI name,
        right click on the resource in the Files or Projects window and choose Properties from the contextual menu and change
        the JNDI name.</li>
