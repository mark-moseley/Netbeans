        <h2>Registering a Sun Java System Application Server Instance</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>To begin developing enterprise applications you must first register an instance of the 
        Java System Application Server with the IDE.</p>

        <p>If you deploy your applications to a remote instance of the
        Java System Application Server, those libraries are available at runtime. However, during 
        development, to compile your project you need a local instance of this server and libraries.</p>
        <p>You can have multiple instances of the Java System Application Server registered with the 
        IDE, but you must first specify the local folder that contains the local installation of 
        the Java System Application Server. You only need to specify the location of the local installation once.</p>
    
        <p><b>To register an instance of the Java System Application Server:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools &gt; Server Manager.</li>
            <li>In the Server Manager, click Add Server to start the Add Server wizard.
            <ul class="note">
                <li>Alternatively, right-click the Servers node in the Runtime window and choose 
                Add Server. </li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Select the Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>Enter a name for the server instance. This name is used to identify the server in the IDE.</li>
            <li>Click Next.</li>
            <li>Supply the installation location of the Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 and click Next. 
            You only need to specify the location the first time you register an instance of the server. 
            This step in the wizard is skipped when you register additional instances of the server.</li>
            <li>Enter the location (host:port) or select one from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>Specify the Domains Folder and Instance Name, if necessary.</li>
            <li>(optional) Enter the username and password.</li>
            <li>Click Finish to return to the Server Manager dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click Close.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you do not enter the username and password when you register the server, 
            when the server starts a dialog box appears asking for the username and password.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once a server instance is registered with the IDE, its node is visible in the Runtime 
        window under the Servers node. 
        You can perform the following tasks by right-clicking 
        the server instance node and choosing from the pop-up menu:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Start and stop the server instance</li>
            <li>Remove the instance of the Java System Application Server</li> 
            <li>Open the Java System Application Server admin console</li> 
            <li>View the server log file</li> 
            <li>View the Java System Application Server properties</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To remove an instance of the Java System Application Server:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools &gt; Server Manager.</li>
            <li>In the Server Manager, select the Java System Application Server from the list of servers in the left pane.</li>
            <li>Click Remove.</li>
            <li>Click Close.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>
                Alternatively, right-click the server instance in the Runtime window and 
                choose Remove from the pop-up menu.
            </li>
        </ul>
