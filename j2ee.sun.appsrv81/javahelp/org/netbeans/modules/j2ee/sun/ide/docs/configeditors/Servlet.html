<h2>Servlet</h2>
<p>Configure properties for a servlet.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Servlet Name: Read-only field displaying the servlet name for
identification purposes only.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Run As Role: If a run-as role name was designated in the web.xml
file, then this field displays the run-as role value (read only). If no
run-as role name was specified in the web.xml file, then this field is
blank and disabled.<br>
  </li>
  <li>User in Role: This field is disabled if the run-as role field is
disabled. If the run-as role field displays a value, then the user can
set a role name that becomes the principal role under which the servlet
is run.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Web Service Endpoints: Edit existing Web service endpoint values
or enter new Web service endpoint values. This operation opens a pop-up
dialog window from which you can designate the following endpoint
values:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Port Component Name. This field is required. It should be the
unique name of the port within the module.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Endpoint Address URI. This field is not required if the servlet
services only one endpoint. Otherwise, it should indicate the endpoint
address of the endpoint that the servlet services.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Transport Guarantee. This value is optional. It may be set by
selecting from the pull-down list of values: None, Integral, or
Confidential. None indicates that the application does not require any
transport guarantees. Integral indicates that the application requires
that the data sent between client and
server be sent in such a way that it can&#8217;t be changed in transit.
Confidential <span class="cCode"></span>means the application requires
that the data be transmitted in a
fashion that prevents other entities from observing the contents of the
transmission. A value of Integral or Confidential indicates that the
use of SSL is required.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
