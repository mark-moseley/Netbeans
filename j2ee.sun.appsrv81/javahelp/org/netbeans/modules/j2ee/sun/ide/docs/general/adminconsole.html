    <h2>Accessing the SJS Application Server Admin Console</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>The Sun Java System Application Server instance node in the IDE provides a subset of the functions 
    found in the Admin Console of the SJS Application Server. You can manage server
    resources through the IDE (SJS Application Server node), or by using the SJS Application Server Admin Console.</p>
    
    <p><b>To access the SJS Application Server Admin Console:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the SJS Application Server is running. (Denoted by [running] next to the server instance in the Runtime window.)</li>
        <li>Right-click on the Sun Java System Application Server instance and choose View Admin Console.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The login screen for the Admin Console launches in your browser. 
    After you login, you can see that the options on the left
    are similar to those in the Runtime window in the IDE.</p>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>To access the Admin Console, you are required to login as the server administrator.
        The default username is <tt>admin</tt>. Unless the password has been changed, the default
        password is <tt>adminadmin</tt>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you manage resources directly through the Admin Console, the resources are not directly associated with your project.</p>
