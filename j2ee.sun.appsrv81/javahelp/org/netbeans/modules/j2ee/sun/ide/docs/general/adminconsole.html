    <h2>Accessing the Java System Application Server Admin Console</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>The Sun Java System Application Server instance node in the IDE provides a subset of the functions 
    found in the Admin Console of the Java System Application Server. You can manage server
    resources through the IDE (Sun Java System Application Server node), or by using the Java System Application Server Admin Console.</p>
    
    <p><b>To access the Java System Application Server Admin Console:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the Java System Application Server is running. (Denoted by the running badge (&nbsp;<img src="../images/main-project-badge.gif">&nbsp;) next to the Sun Java System Application Server node in the Runtime window.)</li>
        <li>Right-click on the Sun Java System Application Server instance and choose View Admin Console.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The login screen for the Admin Console launches in your browser. 
    After you log in, you can see that the options on the left
    are similar to those in the Runtime window in the IDE.</p>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>To access the Admin Console, you are required to log in as the server administrator.
        The default username is <tt>admin</tt>. Unless the password has been changed, the default
        password is <tt>adminadmin</tt>. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you manage resources directly through the Admin Console, the resources are not directly associated with your project.</p>
