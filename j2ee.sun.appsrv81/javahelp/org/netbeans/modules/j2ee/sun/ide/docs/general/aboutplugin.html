        <h2>About the Sun Java System Application Server</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>        
        <p>The Sun Java System Application Server is a Java EE
        compatible application server that supports
        JavaServer Pages<small><sup>TM</sup></small> (JSP<small><sup>TM</sup></small>), Java Servlet,
        and Enterprise JavaBeans<small><sup>TM</sup></small> (EJB<small><sup>TM</sup></small>) component-based applications.</p>
        <p>Use this server and its libraries for the following activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deploying enterprise applications and enterprise beans.</li>
            <li>Deploying web services and web service clients that use JSR-109 or JSR-101 stubs.</li>
            <li>Deploying web applications, JSP pages, and servlets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Libraries included with the Java System Application Server can be used 
            to compile web services and clients, verify that your application
            implements the Java EE specification correctly, create a new web application with
            JavaServer Faces (JSF) support, or add JSF support to an existing web application.</p>

        <p>Once the Java System Application Server is registered with the IDE, the server instance is visible in the Servers 
        node in the Runtime window. When the Java System Application Server is running, you can expand the server instance node 
        to see the deployed applications and modules and modify the properties of resources on the server from within the IDE.</p>
        <p>You can do the following directly through the Sun Java System Application Server node:</p> 
        <ul>      
            <li>Undeploy applications</li>
            <li>Enable and disable applications</li>
            <li>Identify which applications are currently running</li>
            <li>Configure JDBC resources and other resource properties</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the Java System Application Server is running, you can expand the server instance node in the Runtime window to see the server resources and applications deployed to the server instance.
