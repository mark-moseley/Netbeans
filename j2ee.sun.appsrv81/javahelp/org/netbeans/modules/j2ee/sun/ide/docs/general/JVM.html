        <h2>Modifying JVM Properties of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You can set and modify the properties for the JVM of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish
        by modifying the JVM properties sheet for the server. You can open the properties sheet from the Services window.</p>
        <p><b>To modify the JVM properties:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure that the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish instance is running.</li>
            <li>In the Services window, expand the Servers node and the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish instance.</li>
            <li>Right-click the JVMs node and choose Properties to bring up the properties window.</li>
            <li>In the Properties window, you can modify the follow properties of the JVM:

            <ul>
                <li><b></b></li>
                <li><b>debug-options.</b> Enter or edit debug options. Note that using an
                option of&nbsp; transport=dt_shmem is only supported on Windows.</li>
                <li><b>server-classpath.</b> Click the box to add a directory or JAR/ZIP
                file to the server classpath. You can also remove directories or JAR/ZIP files currently in the server
                classpath and reorder the classpath references.</li>
                <li><b>classpath-prefix.</b> Click the box to add a directory or JAR/ZIP
                file to the beginning of the classpath. You can also remove directories or JAR/ZIP files currently in the classpath
                and reorder the classpath references.</li>
                <li><b>RMIC-options.</b> Command-line options for RMIC compiler.</li>
                <li><b>jvm-options.</b> Displays the JVM options. Edit options directly or
                click the box to edit options with the editor.
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a JVM-option in the Item List to edit or remove that option.</li>
                    <li>Add new options by entering the options in the Item field and then clicking Add.</li>
                    <li>Options in the Item List can be moved up or down. Select the item to reposition and click Up or Down.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Javac-options.</b>  Displays the Javac options. Edit options directly or click the box to edit options with the editor.</li>                
                <li><b>native-library-path-prefix.</b> Add entries to the beginning of the
                native library path. The native library path is a concatenation of the
                server&#8217;s relative
                path for its native shared libraries, the standard JRE native library
                path, the shell environment setting (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on UNIX), and any
                path specified on the JVM Profiler Settings page.</li>
                <li><b>java-home.</b> The name of the installation directory of the Java 2
                Standard Edition (J2SE) software.</li>
                <li><b>classpath-suffix.</b> Click the box to add a directory or JAR/ZIP
                file to the end of the classpath. You can also remove directories or
                JAR/ZIP files currently in the JVM classpath and reorder the classpath references.</li>
                <li><b>native-library-path-suffix.</b> Add entries to the end of the native
                library path. The native library path is a concatenation of the
                server&#8217;s relative
                path for its native shared libraries, the standard JRE native library
                path, the shell environment setting (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on UNIX), and any
                path specified on the JVM Profiler Settings page.</li>
                <li><b>env-classpath-ignored.</b> Set to true to ignore env-classpath. This
                is the recommended setting.</li>
                <li><b>bytecode-preprocessors.</b> Enter a comma-separated list of class
                names. Each class must implement the
                com.sun.appserv.BytecodePreprocessor interface. Classes are called in
                the order specified.</li>
                <li><b>debug-enabled.</b> Set to true to enable debug mode; otherwise, set
                to false to disable debug mode. If set to true, set the jpda_port_number.</li>

                <li><b>jpda_port_number/shared_memory.</b> This property is determined by
                the transport setting in debug-options. If the transport value is
                dt_shmem, then this property is shared_memory. If the transport value
                is dt_socket, then this property is jpda_port_number. You can change
                the value of shared_memory or of the port number. Set the port number
                for the Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA). For debugging, you must also enable
                debugging by setting debug-enabled to true and set desired debug options. </li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Close the window.</li>
