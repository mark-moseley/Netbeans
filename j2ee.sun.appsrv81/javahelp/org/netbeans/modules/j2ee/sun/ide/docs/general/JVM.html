        <h2>Modifying JVM Properties of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You can set and modify the properties for the JVM of the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish
        by modifying the JVM properties sheet for the server. You can open the properties sheet from the Services window.</p>
        <p><b>To modify the JVM properties:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure that the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish instance is running.</li>
            <li>In the Services window, expand the Servers node and the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish instance.</li>
            <li>Right-click the JVMs node and choose Properties to bring up the properties window.</li>
            <li>In the Properties window, you can modify the follow properties of the JVM:

            <ul>
                <li><b>NativeLibraryPathSuffix.</b> Add entries to the end of the native
                library path. The native library path is a concatenation of the
                server&#8217;s relative
                path for its native shared libraries, the standard JRE native library
                path, the shell environment setting (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on UNIX), and any
                path specified on the JVM Profiler Settings page.</li>
                <li><b>RMICOptions.</b> Command-line options for RMIC compiler.</li>
                <li><b>JVMOptions.</b> Displays the JVM options. Edit options directly or
                click the box to edit options with the editor.
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a JVM-option in the Item List to edit or remove that option.</li>
                    <li>Add new options by entering the options in the Item field and then clicking Add.</li>
                    <li>Options in the Item List can be moved up or down. Select the item to reposition and click Up or Down.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>DebugOptions.</b> Click the box to enter or edit debug options. 
                The default transport value is <tt>dt_socket</tt>.
                When <tt>transport=dt_socket</tt>, the <tt>address</tt> value refers to the 
                Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) port number. 
                The default address setting is <tt>address=9009</tt>.
                You can modify the <tt>address</tt> value to change the JPDA port.
                For debugging, you must also enable
                debugging by setting the debug-enabled property to <tt>true</tt>.
                <br><b>Note:</b> On Windows, you can use shared memory transport by setting the transport
                option to <tt>transport=dt_shmem</tt> and then modifying the <tt>address</tt> property as necessary.
                <p>For more on JPDA connection settings, see the following document:

                <li><b>DebugEnabled.</b> Set to true to enable debug mode; otherwise, set
                to false to disable debug mode. If set to true, set the JPDA port number by 
                modifying the value for the <tt>address</tt> property in the Debug Options.
                The default address setting is <tt>address=9009</tt>.</li>
                <li><b>JavaHome.</b> The name of the installation directory of the Java 2
                Standard Edition (J2SE) software.</li>
                <li><b>ClasspathPrefix.</b> Click the box to add a directory or JAR/ZIP
                file to the beginning of the classpath. You can also remove directories or JAR/ZIP files currently in the classpath
                and reorder the classpath references.</li>
                <li><b>SystemClasspath</b> Click the box to modify the path to the application server launcher JAR file.</li>
                <li><b>ClasspathSuffix.</b> Click the box to add a directory or JAR/ZIP
                file to the end of the classpath. You can also remove directories or

                <li><b>NativeLibraryPathPrefix.</b> Add entries to the beginning of the
                native library path. The native library path is a concatenation of the
                server&#8217;s relative
                path for its native shared libraries, the standard JRE native library
                path, the shell environment setting (LD_LIBRARY_PATH on UNIX), and any
                path specified on the JVM Profiler Settings page.</li>
                <li><b>BytecodePreprocessors.</b> Enter a comma-separated list of class
                names. Each class must implement the
                com.sun.appserv.BytecodePreprocessor interface. Classes are called in
                the order specified.</li>
                <li><b>ServerClasspath.</b> Click the box to add a directory or JAR/ZIP
                file to the server classpath. You can also remove directories or JAR/ZIP files currently in the server
                classpath and reorder the classpath references.</li>
                <li><b>EnvClasspathIgnored.</b> Set to true to ignore env-classpath. This
                is the recommended setting.</li>
                <li><b>JavacOptions.</b>  Displays the Javac options. 
                Edit options directly or click the box to edit options with the editor.</li>
