        <h2>New JDBC Resource: General Attributes</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You see this page of the New File wizard when you are <a href="../general/def_jdbcresource.html">defining a JDBC resource</a>.
        On this page you choose a connection pool and specify the JNDI name of the resource.</p>
        
        <p>When making a connection to a relational database, the application calls up the JDBC resource using the JNDI 
        resource name. The JDBC resource (datasource) specifies the connection pool used to connect to a database.</p>
        <p>Use this page as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To create a JDBC resource, you first need to define a connection pool. Choose one of the following connection pool options:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Use Existing JDBC Connection Pool.</b> If selected, select from the drop-down list one of the connection pools 
                already registered with the default server instance.
                If the connection pool you want does not appear in the list, ensure that it is 
                registered with the default server instance. If no connection pools are listed and you see
                &lt;No JDBC Connection Pool&gt; in the drop-down list, ensure that the server instance is running.</li>
                <li><b>Create New JDBC Connection Pool.</b> Select this option to create a new connection pool in the 
                wizard. 
                <ul class="note"><li>Alternatively, you can create a JDBC Connection Pool in the New File wizard. 
                    Click Back to return to the first screen of the New File wizard and select JDBC Connection Pool in the File Types pane.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Enter values for the following fields:
            <ul>
                <li><b>JNDI name.</b> The JNDI name for the resource is required and must be unique to this JDBC resource.
                The JNDI name of a JDBC resource is expected in the <tt>java:comp/env/jdbc</tt> subcontext. 
                For example, the JNDI name for the resource of a payroll database could 
                be <tt>java:comp/env/jdbc/payrolldb</tt>. Because all resource JNDI names are in 
                the <tt>java:comp/env</tt> subcontext, when you specify the JNDI name of a JDBC 
                resource enter only jdbc/name. For example, for a payroll database, specify <tt>jdbc/payrolldb</tt>.</li>
                <li><b>Object-types.</b> The type of the object. A resource object may be
                user, system-all, system-admin, or system-instance.</li>
                <li><b>Enabled.</b> Set to true to enable the resource, or false to disable the resource.</li>
                <li><b>Description.</b> Description of the resource (optional).</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Click Next.</li>
        </ol>
