BPEL BluePrint 4: Message-Based Coordination of Events Using BPEL<br><br>

Creates a sample BPEL Module project and a Composite Application project that
illustrate message-based coordination of events within the context of an Order
Fulfillment business process. This pattern describes how a BPEL process can
respond to events that might occur during execution as well as execute different
paths based on the received message. Refer to the BPEL BluePrint4 documentation
for more information on using this sample.
