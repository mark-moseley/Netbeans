        The synchronous BPEL process illustrates a simple synchronous
        flow. The process receives an input message and sends it back
        synchronously. A client starts the synchronous process by invoking
        a request-response operation. After invoking a synchronous process,
        the client is blocked until the process finishes and returns the result.
