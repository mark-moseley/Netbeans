/**
 * This class is designed for a privilege access to component. Each component could have a set of presenters attached to it.
 * The presenters are created by ComponentDescriptor.createPresenters method on behalf of a component. The createPresenters
 * method is called when a descriptor is reassigned to a component or a new component is created. The creation of a presenter
 * basically means nothing and should be as fast as possible.
 * <p>
 * If you want to have a presenter that will react on changes in document, you should use DynamicPresenter.
