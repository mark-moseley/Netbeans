This package contains built-in graph-oriented models. They are based on a <code>ObjectScene</code> class.
<p>
The <code>GraphScene</code> provides a model with nodes and edges.
An edge can have a source and target node specified.
<p>
The <code>GraphPinScene</code> providers a model with nodes, pins and edges.
A pin is always assigned to a node and an edge can have a source and target pin specified.
