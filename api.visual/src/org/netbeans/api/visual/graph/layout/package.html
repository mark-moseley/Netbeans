<p>
This package contains built-in graph-oriented layout algorithms.
This layout is not related with widget-oriented layout in <code>org.netbeans.api.visual.layout</code> package.
There is <code>GraphLayout</code> class which is used for defining a graph layout.
The layout implementation does not have be based this class but it would make its integration with the rest of the library easier.
