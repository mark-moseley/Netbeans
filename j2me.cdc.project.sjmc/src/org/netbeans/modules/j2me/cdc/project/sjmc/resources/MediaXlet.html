Creates a new xlet. The xlet application programming model is very similar
to the applet application programming model. Xlets are loaded into an xlet
manager and controlled through a life cycle interface. This is similar to
how an applet is loaded and run inside a browser. The main difference is
that the xlet application programming model does not have implicit API
requirements like java.applet which allows it to be used in a greater
variety of product scenarios.
<b>Note</b>: This template does not contain form code that 
allows you to design the xlet visually in the Form Editor. For visual
design, start with the Xlet template under Java GUI Forms.
