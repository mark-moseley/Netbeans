    name:          (String, required) The name of this macro.
    descriptionId: (String) A resource bundle key with description text for
                   this macro. Modules are encouraged to use this
                   instead of <description/> element to make their macros
                   localizable.
    remove:        When 'true' this macro will be removed and all its
                   optional attributes and elements will be ignored.
