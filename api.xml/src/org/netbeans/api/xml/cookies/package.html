XML data objects polymorphism cookies.

<h2>XML Tools Cookies API</h2>

XML tools API supports XML polymorfic nature by defining a set of XML related
<a title='NetBeans cookie pattern description'
href="http://www.netbeans.org/download/apis/org/openide/loaders/doc-files/api.html#cookie">cookies</a>.
This approach allows to define actual data object independent actions etc.

<h3>No UI Interaction Pattern</h3>
Most XML cookie interfaces use <b>no UI interaction</b> pattern.
It means that a cookie specification states that its implementation cannot
change UI state. UI is responsibity of cookie client that is
supported by the cookie with provided notification interface.

<h2>Plans</h2>
Once a MDR will be ready we can add model access cookies if not covered by 
MDR integration module.
