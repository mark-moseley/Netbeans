<title>XML Tools Cookies API</title>
  
<h2>XML Tools Cookies APIs</h2>

Currently we propose two common cookies. Once a MDR will be ready we can add
model access APIs if not covered by MDR itself.

<h3>No UI Interaction Rule</h3>
We are proposing here to use <b>No UI inetraction rule</b> for all cookie interfaces.
It means that a cookie specification should state that implementation
cannot change state of UI. Rather it should provide a UI hook that can be plugged
in by a cookie user (that is responsible for UI interaction).
