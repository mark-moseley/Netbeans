<h2>XML Tools Cookies APIs</h2>
Currently we propose two common cookies. 

<h3>CheckXMLCookie vs. ValidateXMLCookie</h3>
Both cookies are supported because it mimics users requests for separating
fast syntax level check actions and accurate semantics level actions.

<h3>No UI Interaction Rule</h3>
We are proposing here to use <b>No UI intaraction rule</b> contrain for most
cookie interfaces. It means that a cookie specification should state that
implementation cannot change UI state. Rather the cookie interface should
provide a UI hook that can be plugged in by a cookie client (that is responsible
for UI interaction).

<h2>Plans</h2>
Once a MDR will be ready we can add model access cookies if not covered by 
MDR integration module.
