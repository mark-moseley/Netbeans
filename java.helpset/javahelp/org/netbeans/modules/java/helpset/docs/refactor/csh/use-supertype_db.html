        <h2>Use Supertype Where Possible Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>

        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Use Supertype Where Possible refactoring command.
        You can use the Use Supertype Where Possible command to change code that references the 
selected class (or other type) so that it references a supertype of the selected type. 
        Before replacing those references, the IDE checks to make sure that supertype
and its members are accessible to all of the code that would be changed to reference them.</p>
       

        <p>You can open the Use Supertype Where Possible dialog box by choosing Refactor &gt; Use Supertype Where Possible 
            after you have selected a class or other type in the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. 
        </p>
        <p>The dialog box has the following field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Supertype to Use.</b> Drop-down list from which you can choose the 
            supertype that you want the code to be changed to reference.
Contains the name of the class to be moved.
            </li>
        </ul>
            

       <p>If you want to preview the changes, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Preview. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
