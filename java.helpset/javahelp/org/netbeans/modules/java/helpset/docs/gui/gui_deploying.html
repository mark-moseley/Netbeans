        <h2>Deploying Java GUI Applications</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        <p>In order for the applications that you create to work 
        outside of the IDE, you might have to include some extra JAR files 
        when you deploy the application. </p>
        <p>The following JAR files might be needed by your deployed applications:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><tt>swing-layout-1.0.3.jar</tt>. This library contains the various layout-related  
        extensions, such as the GroupLayout layout manager. This library is included in 
    version 6 of the Java Platform, so you do not need to package it with your application 
if you are deploying it to environments that have version 6 of the JRE.</li> 
<li><tt>appframework-1.0.3.jar</tt> and <tt>swing-worker-1.1.jar</tt>. 
    These libraries represent the Swing Application Framework. 
    They are needed if you use the 
    Java Desktop Application template in creating your application. As of 
JDK 6, the Swing Application Framework is not part of the Java Platform.</li>
<li><b>Beans Binding</b>. This library contains support for the beans binding. If your 
    application is created with the Database shell of the Java Desktop Application 
    template or you have used the Bind dialog box in creating your application, 
    your application needs this library. As of 
JDK 6, the Beans Binding library is not part of the Java Platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="note"> 
            <li>You can find these JAR files in the
            following folders on your system: 
            <blockquote>
                <tt><i>NetBeans_installation_folder</i>/java2/modules/ext/ (for the Beans Binding and Swing Application Framework libraries)</tt>
                <tt><i>NetBeans_installation_folder</i>/platform8/modules/ext/ (for the Swing Layout Extensions library)</tt>
            </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>  
        
    <h3>Preparing a GUI Application for Distribution</h3>
    <p>To ensure that your GUI application can reference these libraries at
        runtime, the IDE automatically copies the library JAR files (and any other JAR 
        files on the project's classpath) to the <tt>dist/lib</tt> folder 
        whenever you build the project. The IDE also adds each of the JAR files 
        to the Class-Path element in the application JAR's <tt>manifest.mf</tt> 
        file.</p>
        <ul class="note"> 
            <li>If your application does not make use of the support of one of 
            these libraries, that library is not included in the <tt>dist/lib</tt> 
        folder.</li>
        </ul>  
                    
        <p><b>To prepare your GUI application for distribution outside of the IDE:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zip the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder (including the lib folder) 
            into a ZIP archive.</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Running a Standalone GUI Application</h3>
    <p>Once you have distributed an archive of your GUI application, 
    your application can be run outside of the IDE from the command line.</p>
        <p><b>To run a standalone GUI application from the command line:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the project's <tt>dist</tt> folder.</li>
            <li>Type the following:
                <blockquote>
                    <tt>java -jar <i>jar_name.jar</i></tt>
                </blockquote></li>
        </ol>
