        <h2>Extract Superclass Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Extract Superclass refactoring command.
        You can use the Extract Superclass command to create a new superclass based 
        on public non-static methods in the selected class. </p>
       
        <p>You can open the Extract Superclass dialog box by choosing Refactor &gt; Extract Superclass 
            after you have selected a class in the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. 
        </p>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Superclass Name.</b> Contains the name of the class 
                to be created.
            </li>
            <li><b>Members to Extract.</b> List of inner classes, methods, and fields that you can include 
                in the new superclass. 
<p>For each member that you want to include in the 
                superclass, select the checkbox in the left column.</p>
                In the Make Abstract column, select the checkbox for any methods 
                that you do not want to have an implementation generated for.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Preview All Changes.</b> If selected, a list of all 
                parts of your code to be affected by the refactoring is displayed in the 
                <a href="previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> after you click Next. You can then clear any occurrences of 
                the name that you do not want changed.
                <p>If Preview All Changes is not selected, the refactoring is done immediately after you 
                click Next.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unless you clear the Preview All Changes checkbox, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
