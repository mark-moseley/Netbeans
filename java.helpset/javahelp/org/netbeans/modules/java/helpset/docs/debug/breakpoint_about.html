<h2>Breakpoints in the IDE</h2>
<p>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> A breakpoint is a flag in the source code that tells the debugger to stop
	execution of the program. When your program stops on a breakpoint, you can
	perform actions like examining the value of variables and single-stepping through your program. </p>
<p>The IDE enables you to set several types of breakpoints using the New Breakpoint
	dialog. You can also set line breakpoints directly in the Source Editor. Breakpoints
	can be set for the following types of source elements: </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Class. </b>You can break when the class is loaded into the virtual machine,
    unloaded from the virtual machine, or both.</li>
  <li><b>Exception.</b> You can break whenever a specific exception is caught,
  	whenever a specific exception is not handled in the source code, or whenever
  	any exception is encountered regardless of whether the program handles the
  	error or not.</li>
  <li><b>Field.</b> You can stop execution of your program whenever a field
  	in a specific class is accessed (for example, the method was called
  	with the variable as an argument), modified or both.</li> 
  <li><b>Method.</b> Program execution stops every time the method is entered, exited or both.</li> 
  <li><b>Thread.</b> You can break program execution whenever a thread starts,
  	stops, or both.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Source Editor indicates a breakpoint by highlighting the line at which the
	breakpoint is set in red and placing an annotation in the left margin. The
	following table describes the debugging annotations.</p>

<ul class="note">
	<li>All Java breakpoints are defined globally
		and therefore affect all IDE projects that include the source on which
		a breakpoint is set. For example, if you set a class breakpoint on <tt>com.me.MyClass</tt> in
		one project, the IDE will stop execution every time it encounters that
		class during a debugging session  for other projects that include the class.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view and organize all IDE breakpoints by choosing Windows  &gt; Debugging  &gt; Breakpoints
(Alt-Shift-5).</p>
