<h2>Encapsulating a Field</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
<p>Field encapsulation is the act of restructuring your code so that a field 
is accessed only by a pair of accessor methods. Accessor methods are 
also referred to as read/write methods or getters and setters.</p>
  <p>Typically when you encapsulate a field, you change the 
field's access modifier to <tt>private</tt> so that the field can not
be directly referenced from outside of the class. For other classes to 
reference the field, they have to use the accessor methods.</p>
<p>You can use the IDE's Encapsulate Fields command to:</p>
 <ul>
     <li>Generate accessor methods for fields. The names of these methods 
     take the form of <tt>get<i>field-name</i></tt> and <tt>set<i>field-name</i></tt>.
     <li>Adjust the access modifier for the fields.</li>
     <li>Replace direct references in your code to the fields with 
     calls to the accessor methods.</li>
 </ul>

<p><b>To encapsulate a field:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Source Editor, right-click a field or a reference to the field and choose 
    Refactor &gt; Encapsulate Fields 
    from the contextual menu. 
  <p>The <a href="csh/encapsulate-fields_db.html">Encapsulate Fields dialog box</a> 
  opens.</p></li>
  <li> In the List of Fields to Encapsulate table, make sure the checkbox for 
the field that you want to encapsulate is selected. You can select multiple fields.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Set the field's visibility.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Set the accessors' (getter and setter) visibility.</li>
  <li>(Optional) If you do not want the IDE to replace code to use the accessor 
    methods, clear the Use Accessors Even When Field is Accessible checkbox. 
  <p>This option only has an impact if both of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have direct references to the field in your 
    code.</li>
    <li>You have set the field's accessor modifier so that the field is visible 
    to the classes with these references.</li>
</ul></li>
  <li>If you click Refactor, the IDE applies 
    the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps. If you click Preview,
    the Refactoring window displays the lines of code that will be changed. Review 
    the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. If the 
    class that you are pushing members from has multiple subclasses and you do not 
    want the members to be pushed to all of them, be sure to clear the checkboxes 
    for the corresponding subclasses. Click Do Refactoring to apply the selected changes.</li>
</ol>
    <ul class="note">
    <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
    	any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
    	node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
    </li>
  </ul>
