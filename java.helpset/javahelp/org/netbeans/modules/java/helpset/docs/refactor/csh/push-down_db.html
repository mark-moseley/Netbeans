        <h2>Push Down Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>

        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Push Down refactoring command.
        You can use the Push Down command to move one or more members from 
        the selected class to a subclass. </p>
       

        <p>You can open the Push Down dialog box by choosing Refactor &gt; Push Down  
            after you have selected a class in the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. 
        </p>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Members to Push Down.</b> Contains the list of inner classes, methods, and fields in 
                the current class. 
                <p>Select the checkbox to the left of each member that you want to have 
                moved to the subclass.</p>
                <p>Select the Keep Abstract checkbox for any methods that you have selected to 
                push down for which you would like to keep the 
                method declaration in the current class. </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Preview All Changes.</b> If selected, a list of all 
                parts of your code to be affected by the refactoring is displayed in the 
                <a href="previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> after you click Next. You can then clear any occurrences of 
                the name that you do not want changed.
                <p>If Preview All Changes is not selected, the refactoring is done immediately after you 
                click Next.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you click Preview, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
