        <p>The IDE  provides several tools to simplify the process of building 
        GUI's including: </p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Matisse GUI Builder.</b> The primary workspace within which GUI design 
        takes place in the IDE. The GUI Builder enables you to lay out forms by 
        placing components where you want them and by providing visual feedback in the 
        form of guidelines.
        <li><b>Palette window.</b> A list containing all of the components available for adding to forms.
        You can customize the Palette window to display its contents as icons only or as
        icons with component names. </li>
        <li><b>Properties window.</b> Displays the editable settings for the currently
        selected component.</li>
        <li><b>Connection wizard.</b> Assists in setting events between components
        in a form without the need of writing code manually. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note"> 
        <li>Using the <b>Palette Manager</b>, you can add, remove, 
        and organize Palette window components such as 
        Swing components, AWT components, Layouts, and beans.</li>
