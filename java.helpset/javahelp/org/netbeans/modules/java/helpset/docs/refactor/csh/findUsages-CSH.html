        <h2>Find Usages Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>Use this dialog box to specify search options for the Find Usages command.
You can use the Find Usages command to determine all of the places a class, method,
        or field is used in your project's source code. </p>
        
        <p>You can open the Find Usages 
        dialog box from the Source Editor, Projects window, or Files window. In one 
of these windows, right-click a 
        class, method, or field and choose Find Usages (Alt-F7).</p>
	

        <p>The Find Usages dialog box displays the following option for all types of identifiers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Show in Comments.</b> If selected, occurrences of the identifier that 
            appear in code comments are also displayed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For classes and interfaces, the Find Usages dialog box displays the following 
        additional options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Find Usages.</b> If selected, all usages of the class are displayed.</li>
            <li><b>Find All Subtypes.</b> If selected, usages of all subtypes of the class, 
including subtypes of subtypes, are displayed. Usages of the class itself are not displayed.</li>
            <li><b>Find Direct Subtypes Only.</b> If selected, only usages of direct subtypes 
            are displayed. Subtypes of those subtypes are ignored. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For methods, the Find Usages dialog box sometimes displays the following additional options:</p>
        <ul><li><b>Find Usages.</b> If selected, all usages of that 
        specific method in your project are displayed.</li>
        <li><b>Find Overriding Methods.</b> If selected, the output will show every usage 
        of a method that overrides this method in your project.</li>
        <li><b>Search from Base Class.</b> This option is only relevant if the method for which you 
are finding usages overrides another method. If selected, the output 
        will show every usage of that base method.</li></ul>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>The Find Usages command is 
            distinct from the Find command, because Find Usages returns only occurrences of 
            the specified identifier in Java code. The Find command returns any matching string 
            that you specify in any type of file.</li>
