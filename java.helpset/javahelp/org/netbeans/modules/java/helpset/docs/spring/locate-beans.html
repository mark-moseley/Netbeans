        <h2>Locating Spring Beans</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>When working in a Spring-enabled project, you may often need to quickly reference bean declarations
            that you or other developers created elsewhere within a project. The Go to Spring Bean dialog
            allows you to quickly find Spring beans that you have declared in your configuration files.</p>
        
        <p><strong>To locate a Spring bean:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>From the IDE's main menu, choose Navigate &gt; Go to Spring Bean. The Go to Spring Bean
                dialog opens.</li>
            <li>In the Type Name text field, enter the first few characters of the bean you are searching
                for. The IDE filters the beans whose names begin with the entered characters and displays
                the results in the Types Found pane.</li>
            <li>Click on one of the results, and the configuration file containing the bean declaration
                opens in the Source Editor with the cursor on the first line of the declaration.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>To return results that are case sensitive to your input, select the Case Sensitive option.</li>
            <li>The Location text field displays the fully-qualified path to the source file containing
                the bean.</li>
            <li>In order for the Go to Spring Bean dialog to be able to locate bean references, you must
                ensure that the Spring configuration files that contain bean declarations you are searching
                for are registered with the IDE. To do so, right-click on the project node and choose
                Project Properties. Then, in the Spring Framework category, check that configuration
                files are listed in the Configuration File panel. See <a href="organize-files.html">Organizing
                Spring Configuration Files</a> for more details.</li>
            <li>The Go to Spring Bean dialog retrieves matches by comparing the entered data with a bean <tt>name</tt>,
                <tt>id</tt>, or <tt>alias</tt>.</li>
            <li>You can also press Alt-Shift-B (Ctrl-Shift-B on Mac) to open the Go to Spring Bean dialog.</li>
        </ul>
