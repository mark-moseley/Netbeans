        <h2>Bind Dialog Box: Advanced Tab (Java Desktop Applications)</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>This dialog box enables you to bind properties of JavaBeans components (beans)
with each other so that the values of those properties are synchronized. For example, 
    you can bind the <tt>value</tt> property of a JSlider component to the value of  
    an object in a table so that the value in the table cell is updated as the user 
    adjusts the slider.</p>
    <p>The property for which you open the Bind dialog box serves as the <i>target</i> of the 
binding. In the Bind dialog box, you specify the binding <i>source</i> and configure 
the binding.</p>
    <p>The dialog box opens when you do one of the following things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click a component in the GUI Builder and choose a property from 
        the Bind submenu.</li>
        <li>Click the ellipsis (...) button for a property in the property 
    sheet of a bean.</li>
</ul> 
<p>The Advanced tab of the dialog box contains the following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Name. </b>Enables you to create a name for the binding, 
which gives you more flexibility for managing your bindings. The name is added to 
the constructor of the binding and can be referenced with the binding's <tt>getName()</tt> 
method.</li>
<li><b>Update Mode. </b> Specifies the way that the properties are kept synchronized. 
The possible values are: 
<ul>
        <li><b>Always sync (read/write).</b> Whenever a change is made to either 
        the source or the target, the other is updated.</li>
        <li><b>Only read from source (read only).</b>  The target is only updated 
            the first time the source value is set. Changes that are made to the 
    source are updated in the target. Changes made to the target are not updated in 
the source.</li>        
            <li><b>Read from source once (read once).</b>  The target is only updated 
            when the target and source are initially bound.</li>        
    </ul></li> 
<li><b>Update Source When </b>(available only to the <tt>text</tt> property of JTextField and 
    JTextArea components). Enables you to select the frequency with which 
the properties are synchronized.
</li>     
    <li><b>Ignore Adjusting</b> (available to the <tt>value</tt> property of JSlider; 
    to the <tt>selectedElement</tt> property of JTable and JList; 
and to the <tt>selectedElements</tt> property of JTable and JList). 
If this checkbox is selected, any changes made to one 
property are not propagated to the other property until the user is finished making the 
change. For example, when the application's user drags a slider, the value 
of the property to which the slider's <tt>value</tt> property is bound is only 
updated once the user releases the mouse button.
</li> 
<li><b>Converter.</b> If your binding involves properties with different data 
types, you can specify code that converts values between the types. 
The beans binding library handles many commonly needed conversions, but you might 
need to provide your own converters for other combinations of property types. 
Such converters need to extend the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Converter</tt> 
class.
<p>The Converter drop-down list is populated with any converters that have been 
<a href="../gui_addcomponent.html">added as beans</a> 
to your form. You can also add the conversion code directly by 
clicking the ellipsis (...) button, and selecting Custom Code from the 
Select Converter Property Using drop-down list.</p>
</li>    
<li><b>Validator. </b> Enables you to specify code to validate a change in the target 
property value before propagating that change back to the source property. Such 
a validator needs to extend the 
<tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Validator</tt> class.
<p>The Validator drop-down list is populated with any validators that have been 
<a href="../gui_addcomponent.html">added as beans</a> 
to your form. You can also add the validation code directly by 
clicking the ellipsis (...) button, and selecting Custom Code from the 
Select Validator Property Using drop-down list.</p></li>
<li><b>Null Source Value. </b> Enables you to specify a different value to use if 
the source property has a <tt>null</tt> value when the binding is attempted. 
This field corresponds with the <tt>setSourceNullValue()</tt> method 
    of the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Binding</tt> class.</li>     
    <li><b>Unreadable Source Value. </b> Enables you to specify a different value to use if 
the binding expression can not be resolved when the binding is attempted. 
This field corresponds with the <tt>setSourceUnreadableValue()</tt> method 
    of the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding.Binding</tt> class.</li>    
</ul>
<ul class="note">
<li>To better understand the classes and methods mentioned above, you can 
access the beans binding Javadoc documentation directly 
from the IDE. Choose Help &gt; Javadoc References &gt; Beans Binding. In the browser 
window that opens, click the <tt>org.jdesktop.beansbinding</tt> link to access 
documentation for those classes.</li>
