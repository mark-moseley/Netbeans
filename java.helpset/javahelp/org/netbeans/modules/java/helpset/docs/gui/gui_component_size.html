        <h2>Sizing Components</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p> It is often beneficial to set several related components, such as 
        buttons in modal dialogs to be the same size so they can be easily recognized 
        as offering similar functionality. You can also adjust the resizing behavior 
        of components to ensure that component relationships are maintained at runtime.</p>
        
        <p><b>To set components to the same size:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select all of the components you want to be the same size in the GUI Builder's workspace. </li>
            <li>Right-click any one of components, and choose Set the Same Size > Set Width 
            (or Same Size > Set Height) from the contextual menu.
            <p>The IDE sets the selected components to be the same size
            and adds small graphical to indicate the component relationships.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><b>To set component resizing behavior:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the components whose auto resizing behavior you want to set.</li>
            <li>Right-click any one of the components and choose Auto Resizing > Horizontal 
            (or Auto Resizing > Vertical) from the pop-up menu.
            <p>The IDE sets the components auto-resizing behavior to resize horizontally 
            at runtime. The alignment guidelines and anchoring indicators are updated 
            to indicate the new component relationships. 
            </li>
        </ol>
