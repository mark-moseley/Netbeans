    <h2>Safely Deleting Java Code</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

    <p>You can use the Safely Delete command to have the IDE check for references to a code 
    element before you delete that code element. You can use the Safely Delete command on 
    classes, methods, and fields.</p>
    <p>When you choose the Safely Delete command on a code element, the Safe Delete 
    dialog box opens and helps walk you through the process.</p>
    <p><b>To initiate the Safely Delete operation:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the code element that you want to delete and choose Refactor &gt; Safely Delete.
        <p>You can select the code element by clicking the element's node in the Projects window 
        or by placing the insertion point in an identifier for the code element in the Source Editor.</p></li>
        <li>In the Safe Delete dialog box, make sure that the IDE has identified the right element to 
        be deleted and click Next.
        <ul>
            <li>If the code element is not referenced by other code, the Safe Delete dialog box closes 
and the code element is deleted.</li>
            <li>If the code element to be deleted is referenced by other code, a warning and a 
            Show Usages button appear in the Safely Delete dialog box. See the 
 section below for information on completing or canceling the operation.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Handling Deletions When The Code Element is Referenced</h3>    
    <p>When the message beginning with <tt>References to selected elements were found</tt> 
    appears in the Safely Delete window, you can proceed in one of the following ways:</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Remove the references to the code to be deleted and then continue 
            the Safely Delete operation. 
        </li>
        <li>Click Cancel to cancel the command.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>If you mistakenly delete a code element that is still referenced by 
        other code, you can reverse the deletion with the Refactor &gt; Undo command.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>To remove references to code and continue with the deletion of the class element:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Safely Delete dialog box, click Show Usages.
        <p>The <a href="csh/usagesWindow.html">Usages window</a> opens with a list of the references 
        to the code that you want to delete.</p></li>
        <li>Double-click a node for code that references the class to be deleted. 
        <p>The referencing class opens in the Source Editor.</p></li>
        <li>Remove the reference to the code that you want to delete.
        <p>You can use the Safely Delete command to remove this reference. If there are references 
        to that code as well, you can click Show Usages to open a new tab in the Usages 
        window.</p></li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all references to the code that you want to delete 
        are removed.</li>
        <li>In the Usages window, click Rerun Safe Delete.
        <p>The Safely Delete command will be run again. 
        If there are any references that you have not removed, a warning will appear and 
        you can click Show Usages to resume the process of resolving the references.</p></li>
    </ol>


    <ul class="note">
        <li>If you click Preview in the Safe Delete window, the 
Refactoring window appears after you click Next. Click Do Refactoring to proceed with the 
deletion.</li>
    </ul>
