<h2>Setting a Java Breakpoint</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>All Java breakpoints are defined globally 
and therefore affect all IDE projects that include the source on which
a breakpoint is set. For example, if you set a class breakpoint on <tt>com.me.MyClass</tt> in
one project, the IDE will stop execution every time it encounters that class
during a debugging session for other projects that include the class. </p>

<p><b>To set a line, field or method breakpoint in the Source Editor:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Click in the left margin next to the line in the source code or put the insertion point in the line and press Ctrl-F8.</li>
</ul>
<p>A field, method or line breakpoint is created depending on if the line contains a field declaration, method declaration or other code. 
The corresponding breakpoint annotation is visible in the left margin next to the line of source code.</p>

<p>The IDE tests the validity of set breakpoints when the debugger session is starting or when a debugger session is already running.
If a breakpoint is invalid the IDE uses a broken annotation to indicate the invalid breakpoint and displays an error message
in the Debugger Console.</p>

<p><b>To set all other types of breakpoints:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Source Editor, select the code element on which you want to set
     a breakpoint. For example, if you want to set a class breakpoint on the class 
    <tt>BeanCounter</tt>, select the class name in the class declaration.</li>
  <li>Choose Run &gt; New Breakpoint (Ctrl-Shift-F8). 
  <p>The New Breakpoint dialog box opens with a suggested breakpoint type and target filled in.</p></li>
  <li>If necessary, adjust the suggested breakpoint type in the Breakpoint Type drop-down list.</li>
  <li>Enter the package and class name for which you want to set the breakpoint. </li>
  <li>Set any additional options you require in the New Breakpoint dialog and click OK. 
      <p>The IDE creates the new breakpoint for the selected source element. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>To modify an existing breakpoint:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Windows &gt; Debugging &gt; Breakpoints (Alt-Shift-5) to open the Breakpoints window.</li>
  <li>Right-click any breakpoint and choose Customize to open the Customize Breakpoint dialog box.</li>
  <li>Adjust any settings or actions you require and click OK. 
      <p>The IDE updates the breakpoint for the selected source element.</p> 
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>To enable and disable a breakpoint:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click the breakpoint in the Breakpoints window and choose Enable or Disable.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>You can modify and enable line, field and method breakpoints by right-clicking the breakpoint
icon in the left margin of the Source Editor and choosing from the Breakpoint submenu.</li>
    <li>When a debugging session is running, you can use code completion in the New Breakpoint dialog box.</li>
</ul>
