    <p>The Swing Application Framework is a light framework that simplifies the 
        creation and maintaining of small- to medium-sized Java desktop 
        applications. The framework consists of a Java class library that 
        supports constructs for things such as managing resources, maintaining 
    session state, and creating actions.</p> 
    
    <p>The IDE supports the development of applications based on the 
    Swing Application Framework in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing project templates that contain skeleton implementation of the 
        main framework features.</li>    
        <li>Integration of framework features in the IDE's GUI Builder. Swing 
            Application Framework applications can be designed in the IDE like any 
        other Swing application.</li>
        <li>Generating your application's UI text and other resources in <tt>.properties</tt> 
        files.</li>
        <li>Providing a special property editor for actions in which you can associate 
        an action with keyboard accelerators, text, and a tooltip. In addition, you 
     can specify other attributes for the 
 action, such as properties for when it is selected or enabled and whether the 
action runs in the background.<!--TODO more stuff about blocking, etc.--></li> 
    </ul>
    <p>You can read more about the Swing Application Framework at

    <ul class="note">
        <li>The NetBeans Platform itself can also be used as an application framework. 
            The main difference between the Swing Application Framework and the NetBeans Platform 
            in this regard is scope. The Swing Application Framework is more lightweight and 
            easier to get started with. The NetBeans Platform is more full-featured and 
            better suited for large and extensible applications. For more information on 
            developing applications based on the NetBeans Platform, see 
        <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.apisupport.project/org/netbeans/modules/apisupport/project/docs/about/about-netbeans-platform.html">About the NetBeans Platform</a>.</li>
