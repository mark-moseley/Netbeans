<h2>Breakpoint Dialog Box: Line</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You use this dialog box to set the properties of a line breakpoint.</p>
<p>You can set line breakpoint properties when modifying an existing line breakpoint.</p>
<p><b>To set line breakpoint properties:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Set a new line breakpoint by right-clicking in the margin to the left of the line 
    where you want to set the breakpoint.</li>
    <li>Open the Breakpoints window and right-click the line breakpoint and choose Customize.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can set the following values:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Settings.</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File.</strong> Specifies the name of the source file that contains the breakpoint</li>
                <li><strong>Line Number.</strong> Shows the line number on which the breakpoint is set.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolved URL.</strong> (read-only)  When running the JavaScript debugger,
                the Resolved URL field indicates the location of the file as seen by the browser.
                The line number on which the breakpoint occurs is automatically appended to the URL (e.g.,
                <tt>http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp/javascript.js*:18*</tt>).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Conditions</b>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Condition.</b> A Boolean expression that triggers the breakpoint when the expression evaluates to True. For information on the syntax rules for setting a condition, see <a href="../debug_syntaxrules_breakpointconditions.html">Syntax Rules for Setting a Condition on a Breakpoint</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Break when hit count.</b> When selected, enables you to specify how frequently the breakpoint is triggered. 
            Choose a criteria in the drop-down list and then specify a numerical value.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
	<li><b>Actions.</b> The actions to take when the breakpoint is triggered.
          <ul>
                <li><b>Suspend.</b> Specifies which threads in the program 
                being debugged are suspended when the breakpoint is reached. 
                You can specify no threads, all threads, or the breakpoint 
                thread. The breakpoint thread is the thread that is current 
                when the breakpoint is reached.</li>
                <li><b>Print Text.</b> The specified message is printed in the Debugger Console view of the Output window. For information on the tags you can include in the message, see 
                <a href="../debug_print_breakpoint_message.html">Printing a Breakpoint Message</a>.</li>
          </ul>
	</li>
</ul>
