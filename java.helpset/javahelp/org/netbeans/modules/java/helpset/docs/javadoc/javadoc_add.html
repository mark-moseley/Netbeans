<h2>Adding Javadoc to a Project</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> </p>
<p>You can make Javadoc documentation for a JAR file's class available in the IDE 
by associating that documentation with the JAR file.</p>
<p>If you want to have access to compiled JDK documentation through the IDE, 
see <a href="javadoc_jdk.html">Adding the JDK Javadoc to the IDE</a></p>
<ul class="note">
<li>When you add a required project to a project's classpath, the required
    	 project's Javadoc and sources are automatically added to the project as
    	well.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To add Javadoc for a JAR file:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Tools  &gt; Library
  	 Manager from the main menu.</li>
  <li>In the left pane of the Library Manager, select the project library
  	within which the JAR file you want to add Javadoc documentation to is located.
	     	<ul class="note">
		<li>Only libraries already registered with the IDE are listed in the Library Manager's
  	Class Libraries list.</li></ul>
  <li>If the JAR file for which you want to add Javadoc documentation
  	has not already been added to a registered library, create a new empty library
   using the New Library button. Next, 
			in the Classpath tab click Add JAR/Folder and specify the location of
	the JAR file containing the compiled class files. </li>
        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
	     	<ul class="note">
<li>You can also associate the Javadoc with a JAR file using the project's Project 
Properties window. However, doing so creates the association only for that project. 
Open the Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking the project node and 
choosing Properties. Select the Libraries node in the Categories pane. Then 
select the JAR with which you want to associate the Javadoc and click Edit. 
You can then specify the sources to be associated.</li>
		   	<li>A class library
  					can contain multiple JAR files as well as their Javadoc documentation and
				source code.</li>
     		</ul>
  	<li>In the Javadoc tab, click Add ZIP/Folder and specify the location of the 
    	Javadoc files.</li>
  <li>Click OK to exit the Library Manager.
  <p>The IDE adds the selected JAR files and Javadoc documentation Zip files
  	 to the specified library and automatically registers the documentation in
  	every project that has that JAR file on its classpath. </li>
</ol>

  <ul class="note">   
    <li>When you create a Java class library for a
    	single JAR  file, you can simply add the JAR file to the project's classpath
    	to make the associated Javadoc and source code available. If your
    	Java library contains multiple JAR files, however, you must add the library
    	itself to the classpath. Adding the library to the classpath also makes
    	it easier to share the project with other developers. </li>
