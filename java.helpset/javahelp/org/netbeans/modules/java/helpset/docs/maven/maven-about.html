        <h2>About Working with Maven</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
        <p>Maven is a framework that provides help with managing the project lifecycle,
        including building and managing dependencies.
        Maven projects follow a set of standards that are described with a project object model (POM)
        to ensure consistency between projects. </p>

        <p>When using Maven as the build infrastructure for Java projects,
        Maven uses conventions and patterns in order to provide a uniform build system.
        All Maven projects use a shared set of plugins that are retrieved from the Maven repository
        and Maven executes a defined series of tasks as part of the lifecycle when building the project.
        Unlike Ant, you do not need to explicitly specify all the tasks required for building a project.
        </p>

        <p>Maven support in the IDE includes the following features:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Creating projects from archetypes</li>
            <li>Managing Maven repositories</li>
            <li>Editing the POM</li>
            <li>Running custom Maven goals</li>
        </ul>

        

        <p>For more information, see the Maven documentation.</p>
