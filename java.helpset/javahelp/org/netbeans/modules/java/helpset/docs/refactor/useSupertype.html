    <h2>Using a Supertype Where Possible</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

    <p>You can use the Use Supertype Where Possible command to 
replace references to a type with references to one of the type's supertypes. 
    Before replacing those references, the IDE checks to make sure that supertype
and its members are accessible to all of the code that would be changed to reference them.</p>
    <p><b>To initiate the Use Supertype Where Possible operation:</b></p>
    <ol>
    <li>In the Source Editor or Projects window, select the type to which you 
    want to apply the operation. The type can be a class, interface, or enumeration.</li>
    <li>Choose Refactor &gt; Use Supertype Where Possible.</li>
<li>In the Select Supertype to Use list, select the supertype that you want to be 
referenced in place of the type your code currently uses.</li>
    <li>(Optional) If you do not want to review the changes before they are made, 
    clear the Preview All Changes checkbox.</li>
    <li>Click Next. If you have cleared the Preview All Changes checkbox, the IDE applies 
    the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps.</li>
    <li>The Refactoring window displays the lines of code that will be changed. Review 
    the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. If the 
    class that you are pushing members from has multiple subclasses and you do not 
    want the members to be pushed to all of them, be sure to clear the checkboxes 
    for the corresponding subclasses.
    </li>
    <li>(Optional) Double-click a file name in the Refactoring window to open the file, 
    or double-click a line of code to open the source file and to position the 
    cursor on that line of code.</li>
    <li>Click Do Refactoring to apply the selected changes.</li>
    </ol>

    <!--(E.g. when certain type is public and selected supertype is not public.)
I.e. consider
class A;
public class B extends A;
Class A is not public, there are usages of B which could be replaced by A 
(they use only methods from A). But these usages aren't in the same package as A, 
so they cannot be accessed.

2. Check the access modifiers on supertype features.
Similar scenario as in 1), but represents method. In class B, 
you can have 'public void method()', but in class A the method is declared with 
weaker access modifier, e.g. 'protected void method()'. Then refactoring has 
to check, that all usages which should replace B to A can access the method.
