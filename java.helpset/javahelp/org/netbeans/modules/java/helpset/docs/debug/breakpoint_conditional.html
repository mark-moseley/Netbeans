<h2>Setting a Conditional Breakpoint</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can set conditions on a breakpoint so that execution only breaks if the 
condition is true. You can set conditions on any breakpoint except thread and 
class breakpoints.</p>
<p><b>To set conditions on a breakpoint:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new breakpoint or open an existing breakpoint's customizer as described 
    above. 
  <li> Type the condition in the Condition field. The condition must follow the 
    Java syntax rules. The condition may include anything that can be on the right 
    side of the equal sign (<tt>=</tt>). The condition may also include variables 
    and methods that are within the current context. The following are exceptions: 
    <ul>
      <li> Imports are ignored. You must use fully qualified names, such as <tt>obj 
        instanceof java.lang.String</tt>. </li>
      <li> You cannot access outerclass methods and variables directly. Use <tt>this.<i>variableName</i></tt> 
        or <tt>this$1</tt>. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Conditional line breakpoints have a <img src="images/ConditionalBreakpoint.gif" alt="conditional breakpoint icon">
icon in the left margin of the Source Editor.</p>
