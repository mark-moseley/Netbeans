        <h2>Designing Java GUIs with the GUI Builder</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The IDE's GUI Builder enables you to design GUI's (graphical user
        interfaces) visually. As you create and modify your GUI, the IDE automatically
        generates  the Java code to implement the interface. GUI forms are indicated
        by form nodes&nbsp;(<img src="images/form.gif" alt="Image of a form icon">)
        in the Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. 
        </p>
 
     <h3>Using the GUI Builder</h3>
        <p>Whenever you open a GUI form, the IDE displays it in a Editor tab with
        toggle buttons enabling you to switch between Source and Design views. The
        Design view enables you to work with GUI forms visually while the Source view
        permits editing of the form's source code directly. Each time you select a form's Design
        toggle button, the Palette, Inspector, and Properties windows appear automatically.</p>
        <p>Typically, components are added to a form using  the Palette window and  arranged
        in the GUI Builder workspace. As you work, the GUI Builder automatically displays 
        guidelines suggesting preferred alignment and anchoring for the components you add. 
        Using the Inspector window in conjunction
        with the Properties window, you can then examine and adjust properties of a
        form's components and layout managers, manage component event handlers, and
        define how code is generated.  </p>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>By default, the GUI Builder uses the GroupLayout layout manager for
            all new forms you create. If you want to use another layout manager, you can do so by 
            right-clicking the container, choosing Set Layout, and then choosing 
            the desired layout manager.</li>
            <li>In order for interfaces that you create with the GroupLayout layout 
            manager to run 
            outside of the IDE, they must have the Swing Layout Extensions
            library available. The Swing Layout Extension Library is included in 
            version 6 of the Java Platform, so no additional steps are needed if 
            you develop the application with JDK 6 and deploy in environments that 
            have version 6 of the JRE. If you are developing for earlier versions of 
            the Java Platform, you must bundle the Swing Layout Extension Library 
            with the application. For more information, 
            see <a href="gui_deploying.html">Deploying Java GUI Applications</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Guarded Blocks </h3>
        <p>As you work with a form in the Design view, code is generated automatically
        by the GUI Builder and is displayed in the Source view
        with a blue background. This code is called guarded text and is not directly
        editable. </p>
        <p>Guarded text generated by the GUI Builder's includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blocks of components' variable declarations.</li>
            <li> The <tt>initComponents()</tt> method, in which form initialization
            is performed. This method is called from the form's constructor and though
            it is not editable manually, you can affect the way it is generated by editing
            the Code properties in the component's property sheet.</li>
            <li> The header (and trailing brace) of all event handlers. </li>
        </ul>
		  
<ul class="note">

  </ul>
  
        <h3>GUI Form Hierarchy in the IDE </h3>
        <p>The IDE's Inspector window provides a hierarchical tree view of the form's various components.
        Each form is represented by a root node (<img src="images/formDesigner.gif" alt="icon for root node">)
        within which all components in the form's class
        are contained. All other GUI components are organized into one of the following 
        two subnodes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Form Container node</b> (<img src="images/formobje.gif" alt="icon for Top Form Component Node">).
            Represents the top level of the form's hierarchy and contains the visible
            components currently displayed in the GUI Builder. </li>
            <li><b>Other Components node</b> (<img src="images/formNonVisual.gif" alt="icon for Other Components node">).
            Contains  the form's non-visual components. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>To use the GUI Builder, you must work with
            files that were created with the IDE's GUI form templates. You cannot use
            the GUI Builder to edit GUI forms that were created outside of the IDE.</li>
            <li>You can combine FreeDesign containers and containers using other layout 
            managers together in the same form. </li>            
            <li>Forms created in earlier versions of the IDE are not automatically converted to 
            the FreeDesign layout manager and remain editable in the same way as before.</li>
            <li>New containers added to forms created in earlier versions of the IDE  
            do not assume the FreeDesign layout manager in order to ensure code compatibility. 
            However, you can set it manually in the Set Layout submenu. </li>            
        </ul>
