<h2>Setting the Main Project</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>When you develop a large application consisting of numerous source directories, 
  it is common to split up your code into separate projects. Of these projects, 
  one is typically the entry point for your application and contains the application's 
  main class.</p>
<p>To tell the IDE which of your projects is the main entry point for your application, 
  you set one project to be the main project. The IDE provides commands that act 
  on the main project. For example, running the Build Main Project command builds 
  both the main project and all of its required projects, thereby ensuring that 
  you all of your compiled classes are up-to-date. Only one project can be the 
  main project at any time.</p>
<p><b>To make a project the main project:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Projects window, right-click the project node and choose Set as Main 
    Project.</li>
</ul>
