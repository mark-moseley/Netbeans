<h2>Setting Layout Properties</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> You can modify the appearance of your forms by adjusting general layout manager
  properties as well as properties specific to components.</p>
<p>In the IDE you can modify:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General layout properties which effect all components in a container, such
    as alignment of components and gaps between the components. </li>
  <li>Layout properties specific to a component that is managed by a particular
  	layout manager and which apply to that component alone.
These type of properties are also known as
 constraints.
    <!--For example, when BorderLayout is used,
  the Direction property is set according to which of the five parts of the form
  the component resides in (North, South, West, East, or Center).-->
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>To set general layout manager properties:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the layout manager's node in the Inspector window.</li>
  <li>In the Properties window, select the property you want to edit and enter
    the desired value. Note that the properties vary depending on the layout
    manager and that some layout managers do not have any properties. </li>
  <p>The IDE updates all effected components' positions.</p>
  <!--<p> With some layout managers (BorderLayout, AbsoluteLayout, and Null Layout) 
    you can also change constraints by dragging components in the GUI Builder. 
  </p>-->
</ol>
<p><b>To set layout properties of components:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the component in the Inspector window.</li>
  <li>Click the Properties button at the top of the Properties window.</li>
  <li>Scroll
  		down to  Layout properties, select the property you want to edit and enter
    the desired value.
   	<p>The IDE automatically updates the component's layout behavior.
  		<!--<p> With some layout managers (BorderLayout, AbsoluteLayout, and Null Layout) 
    you can also change constraints by dragging components in the GUI Builder. 
  </p>-->   
  	</li>
</ol>

  <ul class="note">
    <li> Not all layout managers use constraints. These
      layout managers (FlowLayout, GridLayout, and BoxLayout), do not have Layout
      properties and component layout is determined by component order. </li>
  </ul>
