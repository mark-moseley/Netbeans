        <h2>About the GUI Builder</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        <p>In Java applications, the components that comprise a GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) are stored 
        in containers called forms. The Java language provides a set of user interface components from 
        which GUI forms can be built. 

        <p>The IDE's GUI Builder assists you in designing and building Java 
        forms by providing a series of tools that simplify the process. </p>

        <h3>The IDE's Java GUI Tools</h3>
        <p>The IDE provides several tools to simplify the process of building 
        GUI's including: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>GUI Builder.</b> The primary workspace within which GUI design 
            takes place in the IDE. The GUI Builder enables you to lay out forms by 
            placing components where you want them and by providing visual feedback in the 
            form of guidelines.
            <li><b>Inspector window.</b> Displays a tree hierarchy of all
            components contained in the currently opened form. Displayed items include visual
            components and containers, such as buttons, labels, menus, and panels,
            as well as non-visual components such as timers and data sources. </li>
            <li><b>Palette window.</b> A list containing all of the components available for adding to forms.
            You can customize the Palette window to display its contents as icons only or as
            icons with component names. </li>
            <li><b>Properties window.</b> Displays the editable settings for the currently
            selected component.</li>
            <li><b>Connection wizard.</b> Assists in setting events between components
            in a form without the need of writing code manually. </li>
            <li><b>Palette Manager.</b> Enables you to add, remove, 
            and organize Palette window components such as 
            Swing components, AWT components, Layouts, and beans.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In addition, the IDE provides support for the following new specifications:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Swing Application Framework</b>. This framework simplifies 
        many tasks in Java desktop application development. The IDE's support 
        includes a special project template, samples, and visual support 
        for managing actions and resources. You can access the  
        project template from the New Project wizard. Choose File &gt; New Project, 
        select the Java category, and select the Java Desktop Application template.</li> 
        <li><b>Beans Binding</b>. This specification provides a way to synchronize 
        the values of different bean properties. This support also simplifies the 
    creation of desktop database applications. You can access binding features from 
the component property sheets and by right-clicking the components and selecting 
from the Bind menu.</li> 
        </ul>
