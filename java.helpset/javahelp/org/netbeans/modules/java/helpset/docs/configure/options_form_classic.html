        <h2>Options Window: Advanced Options: GUI Builder Settings</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Advanced GUI Builder settings enable you to adjust how the IDE's 
        GUI Builder displays form information,
        to adjust the layout grid size, and to assign specific editors for 
        certain property types.</p>
        <p>You can access the GUI Builder settings in Advanced Options by 
        choosing Tools &gt; Options from the main menu and clicking Advanced Options 
        in the Options window. 
        In the left pane, expand the Editing node and select GUI Builder.</p>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Some of the following properties are only available in Advanced Options.
            To switch between views, click the Advanced Options or Basic Options
            buttons in the Options window.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>General GUI Builder Properties</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Assistant in Designer.</b> If selected, the GUI Builder Assistant is displayed in design view.</li>
            <li><b>Connection Border Color.</b> Color of component selection
            border during connection mode. </li>
            <li><b>Drag Feedback Color.</b> Color of target container during
            dragging. </li>
            <li><b>Form Designer Background.</b> Background color of the Form
            Designer pane. </li>
            <li><b>Form Designer Border Color.</b> Color of the boxes around a
            designed component. </li>
            <li><b>Guiding Line Color.</b> Color of the placement guidelines
            displayed when moving a component.</li>
            <li><b>Automatic Resource Management.</b> Determines whether properties files for internationalization
            strings are generated automatically.</li>
            <li><b>Selection Border Color.</b> Color of the boxes around a
            component that mark it as selected.</li>
            <li><b>Selection Border Size.</b> Size (in pixels) of the boxes
            around a component that mark it as selected. </li>
            <li><b>Palette in Toolbar.</b> If selected, the Add Mode button <img
            src="../gui/images/addmode.gif" alt="image of Add Mode button">&nbsp;appears
            in the GUI Builder toolbar. You can click this button to select any of
            the Palette window's components from the menu that is displayed. </li>
            <li><b>Use Indentation Engine.</b> If selected, the Java Source
            Editor's indentation engine is used when generating Java code. If
            unselected, the GUI Builder's simpler (but faster) indentation is used.
            Regenerating code for large forms can be slow using the Java Source
            Editor's indentation engine. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Expert GUI Builder Properties</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Apply Grid to Position.</b> If selected, the position of
            components is snapped to the grid if a grid is used. The grid is used
            for forms that use AbsoluteLayout or Null Layout, and for JLayeredPane
            and JDesktopPane components. </li>
            <li><b>Apply Grid to Size.</b> If selected, the size of components
            is snapped to the grid if a grid is used. </li>
            <li><b>Property Editor Search Path.</b> List of packages used
            to search the property editor to use in the GUI Builder. For example,
            to use an alternate Color property editor, create <tt>ColorEditor</tt>
            and add its full package name to the beginning of the Property Editor
            Search Path. ColorEditor is then used when the Color property is
            edited. </li>
            <li><b>Event Variable Name.</b> The name of the variable
            generated in the signature of the event handler method for the event
            object. For example, <tt>evt</tt> is the variable name in <tt>private
            void button1ActionPerformed (java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt).</tt> </li>
            <li><b>Fold Generated Code.</b> If selected, the generated code is folded in 
            the Source Editor.</li>            
            <li><b>Generate Mnemonics Code.</b> If selected, the IDE generates
                special mnemonics code using <tt>org.openide.awt.Mnemonics</tt>. This
                option enables you to define labels and button mnemonics using the <tt>&amp;</tt>
                character in the text property instead of setting the text and
                mnemonics properties separately.
                <ul class="note">
                    <li>The generate mnemonics code property is only useful for forms
                    being developed for use in the IDE.
                    To avoid problems with uncompilable code, activating this option should
                    be avoided.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Grid X.</b> Size of the grid in the x axis for AbsoluteLayout,
            Null Layout, JLayeredPane, and JDesktopPane.</li>
            <li><b>Grid Y.</b> Size of the grid in the y axis for AbsoluteLayout,
            Null Layout, JLayeredPane, and JDesktopPane. </li>
            <li><b>Layout Generation Style.</b> Determines the type of code generated.
            Advanced layout features may require additional libraries. </li>
            <li><b>Listener Generation Style.</b> Determines how the code
                for component events and their handlers is generated. All of the
                options produce functionally equivalent code, but each option has
                different performance qualities. There are three options:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Anonymous Innerclasses.</b> One anonymous innerclass
                    is generated for each event. This option might have negative impact on
                    performance and memory of the application, since a lot of classes that
                    must be loaded and kept when the form is executed.</li>
                    <li><b>One Innerclass.</b> One common innerclass is
                    generated for the whole form. This innerclass implements all necessary
                    listeners and dispatches all events to the attached event handlers. The
                    resulting code is less compact and slightly less efficient, but the
                    anonymous innerclasses are eliminated. This option is particularly
                    suitable for large forms with many components and event handlers.</li>
                    <li><b>Main Class.</b> The form's main class implements the
                    listeners. No special innerclass for events is generated. This is the
                    most efficient option, but it does not work well with all types of
                    forms. This option should only be used if the form class does not
                    declare any listener implementation that could interact with events
                    that are generated by components in the form.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <!--<li><b>Property Editors.</b> String pairs that explicitly list the
            property type and the fully qualified class name of the property editor
            to use for that type. </li>-->
            <!--<li><b>Show Mnemonics Info Dialog.</b> If selected, an information dialog
            about Mnenomics functionality is displayed whenever a component's Text
            property is set.</li>-->
            <li><b>Local Variables.</b> If selected, the variables generated for the
            components on the form are declared as local variables in the
            <tt>initComponents()</tt> method. If unselected, the variables are declared as member
            fields of the class. </li>
            <li><b>Variables Modifier.</b> The access modifier for variables
            generated for components on the form. </li>
        </ul>
