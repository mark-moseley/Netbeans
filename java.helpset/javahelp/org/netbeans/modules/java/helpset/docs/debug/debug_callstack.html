<h2>Using the Call Stack</h2>
<p>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>In a debugging session, you can see the call stack for the current thread 
in the Debugging window (opened automatically
whenever you start a debugging session).
If you expand the node for the current thread you can see a list of the
sequence of calls made during the execution of the thread. 
</p>
  
<p>The information given for each call (marked by a <img src="images/call_stack_16.png" alt="Current frame icon"> 
  icon) includes the name of the call, followed 
  by the file name and line number of the call's currently executing statement. 
  If the sources are available, you can right-click the call and choose 
  Go To Source to go to the source code of the call.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can open the Call Stack window by choosing Window  &gt; Debugging  &gt; Call
Stack (Alt -Shift-3). </p>
<h3>Changing the Current Call</h3>
<p>The current call (indicated in bold) is the most recent call made by the current thread. When you select a 
  different current thread, the window is updated to show the calls 
  for that thread. The Local Variables window is also updated to display the values of variables 
  for the current call. </p>
<p><b>To browse the call stack, do any of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>To move one level away from the <tt>main</tt> routine, choose Debug  &gt; Stack 
     &gt; Make Callee Current (Ctrl-Alt-up arrow). </li>
  <li>To move one level toward the <tt>main</tt> routine, choose Debug &gt; Stack 
     &gt; Make Caller Current (Ctrl-Alt-down arrow). </li>
  <li>To make a call current, double-click the call in the Call Stack window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can capture a textual representation of the call stack by right-clicking a a call and choosing Copy Stack from the pop-up menu.
When you copy the call stack, the text is copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the call stack into a text file.</p>

<h3>Popping a Call From the Call Stack</h3>
<p>
You can change the execution of your program so that the next statement to be executed is one of the 
calls made earlier on the stack.
In general, popping, or removing, a call from the call stack
does not undo any effects that the call caused.  For example,
if a call opened a database connection and then that
call is removed, the database connection will remain open.
</p>
<ul class="note"><li>You can only pop a call if the program being debugged is paused.</ul>

<p><b>To pop the most recent call from the call stack:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>From the main menu, choose Debug  &gt; Stack &gt; Pop Topmost Call. 
    <p> The call is removed from the call stack. The program counter is moved to the 
      line before the instruction that made the removed call. If the source code 
      is available, the focus of the Source Editor is set to that line. When you 
      continue program execution, the call is repeated.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>To pop multiple calls from the call stack:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Debugging window, right-click the call that you want to remain at 
    the top of the call stack and choose Pop to Here.
    <p> All of the calls above the selected call are removed from the call stack. 
      The program counter is moved to the line before the instruction that made 
      the removed call. 
      If the source code is available, the program counter moves to that line. 
      When you continue program execution, the call is repeated.</p>  </li>
</ul>
