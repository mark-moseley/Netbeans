<h2>Breakpoints Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Breakpoints window lists all the breakpoints that you set in your projects.
You can open the Breakpoints window by choosing Window &gt; Debugging &gt; Breakpoints. 
If you open the Breakpoints window when a debugging session is running, 
it closes automatically when you end the debugging session. If you open the 
window when no debugging session is running, it stays open until you close it.</p>
<p>By default, each entry contains a short text description of the breakpoint 
and a checkbox indicating whether the breakpoint is enabled or disabled. 
You can enable or disable a breakpoint directly in the Breakpoints window by selecting or deselecting the checkbox.</p>

<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>The icon to the left of the breakpoint summary indicates the type of the breakpoint. </p>
