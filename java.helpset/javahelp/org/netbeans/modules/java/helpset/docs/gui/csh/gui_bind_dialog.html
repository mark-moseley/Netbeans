        <h2>Bind Dialog Box: Binding Tab (Java Desktop Applications)</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>This dialog box enables you to bind properties of JavaBeans components (beans)
with each other so that the values of those properties are synchronized. For example, 
    you could bind the <tt>value</tt> property of a JSlider component to the  
a <tt>text</tt> property of a JTextField component.</p>
<p>The property for which you open the Bind dialog box serves as the <i>target</i> of the 
binding. In the Bind dialog box, you specify the binding <i>source</i> and configure 
the binding.</p>    
    <p>The dialog box opens when you do one of the following things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click a component in the GUI Builder and choose a property from 
        the Bind submenu.</li>
        <li>Click the ellipsis (...) button for a property in the Binding category 
        of the property sheet of a bean.</li>
</ul> 

<p>The Binding tab of the dialog box contains a combination of the following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <!--TODO explain target/source -->
    <li><b>Binding Source. </b> A drop-down list that contains a list of 
visual components and other beans that are available for binding to the property 
that was selected when you opened the dialog box. 
<p>For a bean to be available in this list, it needs to be 
    added to the form. See 
<a href="../gui_addcomponent.html">Adding a Component to a Form</a>.</p> </li>
<li><b>Binding Expression. </b>A combo box where you can select or type a  
property of the binding source to bind to the target property. This list might 
also contain other types of expressions which you can use in the binding. Some of 
the properties offered in this combo box are 
<a href="../gui_bind_synthetic.html">special synthetic properties</a> that are 
added by the beans binding library to enable useful bindings that would not 
be possible with the base set of properties for some components.
<p>The expressions in this dialog box use Expression Language syntax.</p>
<p>Some bindings do not require a binding expression.</p>
    <!--TODO link to EL topic--></li>   
       <li><b>Display Expression </b>(only for <tt>elements</tt> property of 
    JList components). Similar to the Binding Expression field, this property enables you to 
    determine what is displayed for the user in the JList.
        <p>This field corresponds to the <tt>JListBinding.DetailBinding</tt> 
    class.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Import Data to Form </b>(only for <tt>elements</tt> property of 
    JTable, JList, and JComboBox components). Enables you to select columns from a database 
    table to bind to the form. If there is no entity class in your project that represents the 
    database table to which you are binding, the IDE will create such an entity class. 
    <ul class="note">
        <li>If the table to which you are binding has any foreign keys, those keys will not be 
    taken into account in the generation of the entity classes. In such a 
case, it is better to use the 
<a href="../../persistence/csh/persist_new_entityclass.html">New Entity Class Wizard</a> 
to create the entity classes before importing the data to the 
        form.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Available</b> and <b>Selected</b> columns (only for <tt>elements</tt> property of 
    JTable components). After you have used the 
    Import Data to Form button to select a database table, you can use the 
    <b>Available</b> and <b>Selected</b> lists to move items into and out 
of the JTable. The Selected list shows everything that will be displayed 
in the table. 
<p>You can add items to a list and remove items from a list by 
  selecting an item and clicking the &lt; and &gt; buttons, or you 
  can click &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; buttons to remove or add all items.</p>
  <p>You can rearrange the items in the Selected list by selecting 
  an item and clicking the Up or Down button. The order in which items 
  appear in the Selected list is the order in which the columns appear 
    in your table. </p></li>   

    </ul>
