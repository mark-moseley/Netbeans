        <h2>Bind Dialog Box: Binding Tab (Java Desktop Applications)</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>This dialog box enables you to bind properties of JavaBeans components (beans)
with each other so that the values of those properties are synchronized. For example, 
    you can bind the <tt>value</tt> property of a JSlider component to the value of  
    an object in a table so that the value in the table cell is updated as the user 
    adjusts the slider.</p>
    
    <p>The dialog box opens when you do one of the following things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click a component in the GUI Builder and choose a property from 
        the Bind submenu.</li>
        <li>Click the ellipsis (...) button for a property in the property 
    sheet of a bean.</li><!--TODO icon for ellipsis button-->
</ul> 
<p>The property for which you open the Bind dialog box serves as the <i>target</i> of the 
binding. In the Bind dialog box, you specify the binding <i>source</i> and configure 
the binding.</p>
<p>The Binding tab of the dialog box contains a combination of the following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <!--TODO explain target/source -->
    <li><b>Binding Source. </b> A drop-down list that contains a list of 
visual components and other beans that are available for binding to the property 
that was selected when you opened the dialog box. 
<p>For a bean to be available in this list, it needs to be 
    added to the form. See 
<a href="../gui_addcomponent.html">Adding a Component to a Form</a>.</p> </li>
<li><b>Binding Expression. </b>A drop-down list where you can select a  
property of the binding source to bind to the target property. This list might 
also contain other types of expressions which you can use in the binding, such as 
Boolean expressions.

<p>The expressions in this dialog box use Expression Language syntax.</p>
<!--TODO link to EL topic--></li>    
        </ul>
