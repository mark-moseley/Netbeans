<h2>About the Java Source Editor</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Java Source Editor is a full-featured text editor that is integrated with the
  <a href="../../gui/gui_overview.html">GUI Builder</a>, the compiler, 
the <a href="../../debug/CSH/debug_window.html">debugger</a>,
  and other parts of the IDE. You can generally open the Source Editor by 
double-clicking a node in the Projects window, Files window, or 
Navigator window. If a file is open in the GUI Builder, you can click the 
Source button in the editor's toolbar to open the Source Editor.
</p>
<p>This topic introduces the following Source Editor features:</p>

<h3><a name="tabs">Source Editor Tabs</a></h3>
<p>The top of the Source Editor has a tab for each open document. Each tab shows
  the name of the document. If the document has been modified and has not been
  saved, there is an asterisk (*) after its name. </p>
<p>If multiple files are open, you can split the Source Editor view by clicking
 and dragging the tab. As you drag to different parts of the editing
        area, you see a red outline that shows you where the new
        window will open. When one of these boxes appears, you can drop the document
        and split the pane.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>You must close the split file if you want the editor to return to its unsplit
    state. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can right-click a tab to access the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Close All Documents.</b> Closes all files that are open in the Source 
Editor area.</li>
<li><b>Close Other Documents. </b> Closes all files except for the selected file.</li>
<li><b>Save Document.</b> Saves the selected file.</li>
<li><b>Clone Document.</b> Opens a new tab for the same document. This command is 
particularly useful in combination with splitting the window so that you can view 
different parts of the same file simultaneously.</li>
<li><b>Close Window.</b> Closes the selected file.</li>
<li><b>Maximize Window/Restore Window.</b> Maximize Window hides other windows and 
expands the Source Editor to use all of the window space in the IDE. Restore Window 
returns the windows to the state that they were before you chose Maximize Window. 
You can also maximize and restore the Source Editor by double-clicking a tab.</li>
<li><b>CVS.</b> A menu of CVS commands that appears if the file is part of a CVS working directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="toolbar">Toolbar</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="java_editor_toolbar.html">editor toolbar</a> is at the top of the Source Editor window. The toolbar has
  buttons for various navigating and editing shortcuts, which vary according
  to the type of file you are editing. Hold the cursor over a button to display
  a description of the command. </p>
<h3><a name="margins">Left Margin</a></h3>
<p> The left margin displays annotation glyphs that indicate line status, such
  as breakpoints, the program counter, or build errors. See <a href="editor_glyphs.html">Margin
  Glyphs in the Source Editor</a> for a description of the glyphs used. </p>
<p>If you click the left margin of a Java file, a breakpoint is set on the corresponding
  line. You can also click the left margin of a line to remove a breakpoint. </p>
<p>You can right-click the left margin to display a pop-up menu. The margin
  can also optionally display line numbers.</p>
<h3><a name="errorstripe">Error Stripe</a></h3>
<p>The error stripe is the strip to 
the right of the right scroll bar and 
contains marks for various things in your file, such as errors, bookmarks, 
  and comments for the To Do list. The error stripe represents the whole file, not 
  just the lines currently displayed. You can immediately identify whether your 
file has any errors without having to scroll through the entire file. You can double-click 
a mark in the error stripe to jump to the line that the mark refers to.</p>
<h3><a name="status">Status Line</a></h3>
<p> The Source Editor status line is beneath the horizontal scroll bar. The first
  area of the status line shows the current line number and row number in the
  form <tt>line:row</tt>. The second area of the status line indicates the insertion
  mode (INS or OVR). The text area on the right is used for status messages.</p>
<h3><a name="colors">Syntax Coloring</a></h3>
<p> Source code displayed in the Source Editor is syntactically colored. For example,
  all Java keywords are shown in blue and all Java comments in light gray. Guarded
  blocks of Java code generated by the GUI Builder have a light blue background
  and cannot be edited. </p>
<h3><a name="completion">Code Completion</a></h3>
<p>The IDE's code completion feature helps you fill in code and tags as you are typing. 
Code completion is available for Java, JSP, HTML, XML, and Ant files.
  </p>
<h3><a name="pair">Pair Completion</a></h3>
<p>When you edit Java classes, the Source Editor does matching of pair characters
  such as brackets, parentheses, and quotation marks. Closing characters are
  not duplicated if you type them yourself rather than letting the editor add
  them for you. </p>
<h3><a name="insert">Insert Mode and Overwrite Mode</a></h3>
<p>When the Source Editor is in insert mode, the default insertion point is a vertical
  bar, and text that you type is inserted. In overwrite mode, the default insertion
  point is a solid block, and text that you type replaces the existing text. </p>
<p>Use the Insert key to toggle between the two modes. </p>
<p>Whenever the insertion point in the Source Editor is located immediately after
  a brace, bracket, or parenthesis, the matching brace, bracket, or parenthesis
  is highlighted. </p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>If the Source Editor beeps when you try to enter new text, the file is a
    read-only file. </li>
</ul>
