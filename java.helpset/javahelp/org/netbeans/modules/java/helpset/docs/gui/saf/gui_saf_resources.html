        <h2>About Resources in the Swing Application Framework</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        
<p>The Swing Application Framework simplifies the handling of resources in 
    applications and makes it possible for more things to stored in resource bundles. 
</p>
<p>A typical Swing Application Framework application has resource bundles 
at both the application level and the class level. The class-level resource bundles have the same names as their 
corresponding <tt>.java</tt> classes except that they contain the <tt>.properties</tt> 
extension. All of these bundles are encapsulated by a <tt>ResourceMap</tt> object.</p>
<p>You can edit application level resources in the Project Properties dialog box. 
Open the Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking the project's node and 
choosing Properties. The application properties appear in the Application panel 
and the Desktop Application panel.</p>
<p>When you start an application from the Java Desktop Application project template, 
by default your code is generated with the Swing Application Framework's conventions for 
managing resources, such as UI text. The values of component properties that you 
set are stored as resources as well.
</p>
<ul class="note">
    <li>If you do not want values to be stored in <tt>.properties</tt> files, you 
    change the way the values are stored. Click the ellipsis (...) 
button next to the given property in the Properties window. Then clear the 
Define as Resource property.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read more about resource management in the Swing Application Framework's 
API documentation. Choose 
Help &gt; Javadoc References &gt; org.jdesktop.application (Swing Application Framework [JSR-296]).</p>
