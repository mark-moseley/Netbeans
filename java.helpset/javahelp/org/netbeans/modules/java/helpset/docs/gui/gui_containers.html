        <h2>Working with Containers</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Java GUIs are forms comprised of top-level containers within which are grouped
        sub-containers as well as the various components used to provide the desired information
        and control functionality.</p>
        <h3>Controlling View Focus</h3>
        <p>It is often useful to focus work on single subcontainers rather than
        	the entire   form the GUI Builder generally displays. When working with
        	large forms containing complex nested hierarchies of containers, changing
        	the scope of the GUI Builder's focus enables you to concentrate on specific
        	parts of your interface. </p>
        <p><b>To change the GUI Builder's focus to a specific container:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the GUI Builder or Inspector window, right-click the container you
            want to edit. </li>
            <li> Choose Design This Container from the contextual menu.
                <p> The IDE adjusts display of the workspace such that the current container fills the
                work area and hides the form's other components. The form's entire hierarchy
                remains available in the Inspector window. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>To return the GUI Builder's display focus to the entire form:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Right-click the container in the GUI Builder.</li>
            <li>Choose Design Top Container from the contextual menu.
                <p> The IDE adjusts the work area display such that the entire form is visible.
                If the Design Top Container menu item is dimmed, you are already designing
                the entire form. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Reordering Components Within a Container</h3>
        <p> The order of components in a container follows the sequence in which components
        are added. If the layout manager you have chosen for a container does not use
        constraints (FlowLayout, BoxLayout, and GridLayout), the order of components
        also determines how they are arranged visually. You can, however, reorder 
        the components using the Inspector window or by dragging them in the form itself. </p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>With layout managers that use constraints (BorderLayout, GridBagLayout, CardLayout,
            AbsoluteLayout, and Null Layout), the order of components in the container
            does not determine the order in which the components appear. For these containers,
            you can only rearrange the component order in the Inspector window. Although GridBagLayout uses constraints to determine how 
            components are arranged, component order determines the layout when the
            Grid X and Grid Y constraints are not used. </li>
        </ul>
