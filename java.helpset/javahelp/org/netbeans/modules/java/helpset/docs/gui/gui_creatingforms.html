        <h2>Creating a New Form</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>In the IDE, you can create JFC/Swing or AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) forms, 
        pre-built sample application skeletons, or any class that is based
        on the JavaBeans component architecture
        using the provided templates.</p>
        <p>You can create forms within an existing project or you can create 
        a new project that is based on the Swing Application Framework and 
    that already contains a skeleton form.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new project that contains a skeleton form:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project from the main menu. </li>
            <li>Select the Java node in the Categories pane and select the 
            Java Desktop Application template. Click Next. </li>
            <li>Enter a name and location for the project.</li>
            <li>Select an application shell. 
            <p>The Basic Application shell provides a skeleton application 
            based on the Swing Application Framework.<!--TODO - link SAF topic--></p>
            <p>The Database Application shell enables you to quickly generate an 
        interface for a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application 
            that is based on a single database table. It implements a JTable 
            component for viewing contents of the database table; text fields for 
            entering data; and buttons for saving records, adding new records, and 
            so on.</p></li>
            <li>If you have selected the Basic Application shell, click Finish.</li>
            <li>If you have selected the Database Application shell, use the next 
            two pages of wizard to specify a database table and to specify the 
            columns to represent in the master/detail view.</li>
            <p>The IDE creates a project with a skeleton form of the selected type 
            and opens the form in the Design view of the Source Editor.</p>
            </ol>
            <!--TODO better describe Swing App Framework; dangers of db form-->
            <ul class="note">
                <li>The Database Application shell is useful for quickly designing 
            simple applications with a master/detail view. However, applications 
            that have more complex data structures or design considerations, 
            it is better to start with the Simple Application shell and create the 
            application incrementally within the GUI Builder.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To create a new GUI form in an existing project:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Choose File > New File from the main menu. </li>
            <li> In the New wizard's Project combo box, select the project for which you
            want to create the form. </li>
            <li>Expand the Java GUI Forms node in the Categories pane and select the desired
            form template. Click Next. </li>
            <li> Enter the GUI form's class name and location. Click Finish.</li>
                <p>The IDE creates a blank form of the selected type and opens 
                and opens the form in the Design view of the Source Editor.</p>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li> In order to avoid repaint problems at both design
                and run time, only AWT components should be used in AWT forms and only
                JFC/Swing components should be used in JFC/Swing forms. </li>
            </ul>
       
        <h3>GUI Form Types in the New File Wizard:</h3>
        <p> The following table lists the types of form templates available in the IDE.
        Each differs in the design time and run time look of the form as well as in the code
        generated for the form's class. </p>

                		the Form Superclass page of the New wizard. The
                		bean  class that you specify when creating
                		the new form must be in the classpath and must be already
                		compiled. </p>
                  <p>A bean is any class that complies with the JavaBeans component architecture.
                A bean must have a public constructor without parameters. Use any JFC/Swing
                component as an example of a JavaBeans class. For example, you can use <tt>javax.swing.JButton</tt> to
                create a form that will produce a customized button. </p>
                <p> Using this template, you can also create a plain container for holding
                beans by specifying <tt>java.lang.Object</tt> as the superclass. </p></td>
