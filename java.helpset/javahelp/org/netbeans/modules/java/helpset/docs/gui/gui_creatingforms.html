        <h2>Creating a New Form</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>In the IDE, you can create JFC/Swing or AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) forms, 
        pre-built sample application skeletons, or any class that is based
        on the JavaBeans component architecture
        using the provided templates.</p>
        <h4>To create a new GUI form in the IDE:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Choose File > New File from the main menu. </li>
            <li> In the New wizard's Project combo box, select the project for which you
            want to create the form. </li>
            <li>Expand the Java GUI Forms node in the Categories pane and select the desired
            form template. Click Next. </li>
            <li> Enter the GUI form's class name and location. Click Finish.</li>
                <p>The IDE creates a blank form of the selected type and opens it in the
                GUI Builder view of an Editor tab. </p>
        </ol>

            <ul class="note">
                <li> In order to avoid repaint problems at both design
                and run time, only AWT components should be used in AWT forms and only
                JFC/Swing components should be used in JFC/Swing forms. </li>
            </ul>

        <!--<p>
        Templates that start with <tt>J</tt>
        are JFC/Swing form templates, which use the Java Foundation Classes/Swing
        (JFC/Swing) components for building GUIs without native code. Native code
        is code that refers to methods of a specific operating system or that is compiled
        for a specific processor. AWT is the original Java class library
        for building Java GUIs. The AWT contains native code. 
        </p>-->
        
        <h3>GUI Form Types in the IDE:</h3>
        <p> The following table lists the types of form templates available in the IDE.
        Each differs in the design time and run time look of the form as well as in the code
        generated for the form's class. </p>

                <td><p> The template used to create a new form based on any JavaBeans
                		component. The new form can be visual or
                		nonvisual. Specify the class in the Superclass field on
                		the Form Superclass page of the New wizard. The
                		bean  class that you specify when creating
                		the new form must be in the classpath and must be already
                		compiled. </p>
                  <p>A bean is any class that complies with the JavaBeans component architecture.
                A bean must have a public constructor without parameters. Use any JFC/Swing
                component as an example of a JavaBeans class. For example, you can use <tt>javax.swing.JButton</tt> to
                create a form that will produce a customized button. </p>
                <p> Using this template, you can also create a plain container for holding
                beans by specifying <tt>java.lang.Object</tt> as the superclass. </p></td>
