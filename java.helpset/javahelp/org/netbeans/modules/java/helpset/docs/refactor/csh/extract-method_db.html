        <h2>Extract Method Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
        <p>Use this dialog box to specify options for the Extract Method refactoring command.
        You can use the Extract Method command to create a new method from 
        selected code in the IDE. When you 
        use this operation, a method is created and selected code 
        is replaced with a call to the new method.</p>
       
        <p>You can open the Extract Method dialog box by selecting the block of code that you 
            want to have extracted into a method and then choosing Refactor &gt; Extract Method. 
        </p>

        <p>The dialog box has the following fields:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Method Name.</b> Contains the name of the method 
                to be created.
            </li>
            <li><b>Access.</b> Drop-down list containing the four 
                possible accessibility modifiers (<tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>, 
                <tt>&lt;default&gt;</tt>, and <tt>private</tt>). Select the accessibility 
                modifier that you want the method to have.
            </li>
            <li><b>Parameters.</b> Displays the parameters for the method. 
            You can use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the order of the 
            parameters.</li>
            <li><b>Method Signature Preview.</b> Shows the way that the method 
            signature will look based on the values of the other fields in the 
            dialog box.
            </li>

            <li><b>Preview All Changes.</b> If selected, a list of all 
                parts of your code to be affected by the refactoring is displayed in the 
                <a href="previewWindow.html">Refactoring window</a> after you click Next. You can then clear any occurrences of 
                the name that you do not want changed.
                <p>If Preview All Changes is not selected, the refactoring is done immediately after you 
                click Next.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you click Preview, you need to follow these steps 
        to complete the refactoring:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Next. 
                <p>The Refactoring 
                window opens and displays a tree view of the code to be affected by the refactoring.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Check the items displayed in the Refactoring window to make sure that you want them 
            all changed. Clear the checkbox next to any parts of the code that 
            you do not want changed.
            <li>Click Do Refactoring.</li>
        </ol>        
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
                any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
                node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
            </li>
        </ul>
