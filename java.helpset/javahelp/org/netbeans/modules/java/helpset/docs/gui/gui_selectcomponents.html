        <h2>Selecting Components in a Form</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p> The IDE's GUI Builder and Inspector window always display the same
        selected component or components. Selecting a component in one window automatically
        selects it in the other. </p>
        <p><b>To select a single component:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Click the component's node in the Inspector window or click the component
            in the GUI Builder. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To select multiple components, do one of the following:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Hold down the Control key while clicking multiple components in the Form
            Editor or while clicking multiple nodes in the Inspector window.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the GUI Builder, hold
                down the Shift key while holding down the left mouse button and
                drag the mouse over each component in the group. A rectangle is painted
                as the mouse is dragged over the group of components. When the mouse button
                is released, all the components included in the rectangle are selected. </p>
            </li>
            <li> In the Inspector window, select a consecutive group of components by clicking
            the first one, holding down the Shift key, and clicking the last component
            in the group.   </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To select next and previous components:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li> Press Tab in the GUI Builder to select the next component or press Shift-Tab
            to select the previous component. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Controlling Selection Depth</h3>
        <p> When  working with nested components (components within a container like
        a panel for example),  clicking in the GUI Builder always selects the
        most deepest  component at the point of the click. You can, however, select
        nested components on different levels  
        using
        modifier keys, as described below. </p>
        <p> You can also display the contextual menu for the
        selected container or subcomponent  at any time by right-clicking. Note that
        the right-click action does not change the selection depth. </p>
        <p><b>To select the parent container of a selected component:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Press and hold the Alt key. </li>
            <li>In the GUI Builder, click the selected component.
                <p> If the currently selected component does not have a parent container
                (i.e. it is the container component for the entire form), Alt-click selects
                the deepest component at the point of the click. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>To select a subcomponent of a selected container:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Press and hold  both the Alt and Shift keys.</li>
            <li> Click the subcomponent.
                <p> If the currently selected component does not contain any subcomponents,
                the container component for the entire form is selected. 
            </li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li> It is often easier to select components
            using the Inspector window than the GUI Builder. </li>
        </ul>
