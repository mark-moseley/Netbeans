        <h2>Sharing Libraries in a Java Project</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
        
        <p>You can configure most standard Java SE, Web, and Enterprise 
            projects in a way that makes it easy to share libraries 
            with other users. You can specify a location for libraries 
            on which the project relies. You can also specify how the libraries are 
        referenced from your project. </p>
        <p>These options make it easy for you to handle the 
        following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You create a project and need to make it available and buildable to 
                other users, whether they use the IDE or not. They need to be able to 
                access the project through a version control checkout or by unpacking 
                a zip file that you have provided them. Then they should be able to build 
            the application without extra configuration.</li>
            <li>You must start working on an existing project and adhere to 
                a strict set of conventions concerning where project libraries 
                are stored (and whether your build script accesses them with a 
                relative reference or absolute reference). Other users on the 
            team are not using NetBeans and have no plans to switch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can make a project's libraries sharable 
            when you create the project in the New Project wizard. You can  
            convert an existing project to be sharable in the Libraries tab of the Project Properties 
        dialog box.</p>
        <p><b>To make a general Java project's libraries sharable upon project creation:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project.</li>
            <li>In the Java category of the wizard, select one of the standard templates. 
            Then click Next.</li>
            <li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, select the 
            Use Dedicated Folder for Sharing Libraries checkbox.</li>
            <li>In the Libraries field, select the location for the 
                libraries to be stored.
                <p>If the libraries are already included in the IDE, those libraries will be 
                copied to the folder that you have designated.</p>
            <!-- note: what about other types of libraries? --></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><b>To make a web or enterprise project's libraries sharable upon project creation:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project.</li>
            <li>Select one of the standard templates in the Web or Enterprise category. 
            Click Next.</li>
            <li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, select the 
            Use Dedicated Folder for Sharing Libraries checkbox.</li>
            <li>In the Libraries field, select the location for the 
                libraries to be stored.
                <p>If the libraries are already included in the IDE, those libraries will be 
                copied to the folder that you have designated.</p></li>
            <li>(Optional) On the Server and Settings page, select the 
            Copy Server JAR Files to Libraries Folder radio button.</li>
        </ol>        
        <p><b>To make an existing project's libraries sharable:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li>
            <li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Libraries node.</li>
            <li>In the Libraries panel, click Browse to open the New Libraries Folder wizard.</li>
            <li>In the Library Folder page of the wizard, enter a location 
                for the libraries and click Next.
            <p>You can enter the location as a relative reference or an absolute reference. </li>
            <li>In the Actions panel of the wizard, verify the selected action for each 
            listed library. In most cases, the IDE detects the most appropriate action for 
            that library.
            <p>The  following actions are available:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><b>Copy Library JAR Files to New Libraries Folder.</b>  
                    Use this option if the library is not in the  
                    folder that you have selected and you want to have the library JAR files placed there. </li>
                <li><b>Use Relative Path to Library JAR Files.</b>   
                    Use this option if the library is not in the libraries 
                    folder and you need to access the library in its existing location using 
                    a relative path. An entry with a relative reference is added 
                for the library in the libraries folder's <tt>nblibraries.properties</tt> file.</li>
                <li><b>Use Absolute Path to Library JAR Files.</b>    
                    Use this option if the library is not in the libraries 
                    folder and you need to access the library in its existing location using 
                    an absolute path. An entry with an absolute reference is added 
                for the library in the libraries folder's <tt>nblibraries.properties</tt> file.</li>
                <li><b>Use Existing Library in Libraries Folder.</b> 
                    Use this option if there is already a copy of the library in 
                    the libraries folder and you want to use that copy of the 
                library.</li>
        </ul></li>
            <li>Click Finish to exit the Make Project Sharable wizard.</li>
            <li>Click OK to exit the Project Properties dialog box.</li>
            
        </ol>
        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can also use the Libraries node of the Project Properties 
            dialog box to change the location of the libraries folder. If you 
            have already specified a libraries folder, clicking Browse opens 
            a file chooser instead of the New Libraries Folder wizard.</li>
            <li>Free-form project libraries can not be sharable in the ways described in 
            this topic. </li>
            <li>The New Project wizard does not include the sharable libraries option for some standard 
                project templates, such as the Java Desktop Application. However, you can make such 
            projects sharable in the Project Properties dialog box.</li>
        </ul>
