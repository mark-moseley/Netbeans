        <h2>Projects Window (Java Projects)</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Projects window is the main entry point to your project sources. It shows 
            a logical view of important project contents such as Java packages and Web pages. 
            You can open the Projects window by choosing Window &gt; Projects (Ctrl-1).</p>
            
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can specify how Java source files are displayed in the Projects window by 
                right-clicking the Projects window title, choosing View Java Packages As and 
                then selecting one of the following view options:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>List</strong>. When selected, files are displayed according 
                        to their logical structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tree</strong>. When selected, files are displayed in a 
                        directory-based view.</li>
                </ul></li>            
            <li>You can view all of your project contents in a directory-based view in 
                the <a href="files_window.html">Files window</a>. To open the Files 
                window, choose Window &gt; Files (Ctrl-2).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Setting Main Projects</h3>
        
        <p>Whenever you have multiple projects open, one should always be set as the main 
            project. The main project is usually the project that contains an application's 
            main class. The IDE provides shortcut commands to quickly build, run, and debug 
            the main project. In the Projects window, the main project is shown in bold. 
            You can set any project as the main project by right-clicking its project node 
            and choosing Set as Main Project.</p>
