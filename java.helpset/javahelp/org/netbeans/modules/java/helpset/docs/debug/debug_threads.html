<h2>Debugging Threads in the IDE</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>All the threads created in the current session are displayed in the Threads window.
  You can open the Threads window by choosing Window  &gt; Debugging &gt; Threads (Alt-Shift-7).</p>
  
<h3>Changing the Current Thread</h3>
<p> Only one thread is the current thread at any given time. By default, the
	current thread is the thread within the current session from which the debugger
	gained control. When you switch between threads to debug, the Call Stack and
	Local Variables windows are automatically updated to reflect the data applicable
	to that thread. </p>
        
<p><b>To change the current thread:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click any thread in the Threads window to make it the current thread. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suspending and Resuming Threads</h3>
<p> You can suspend execution of a thread if you think it is causing problems
  and then later resume the thread once the problem is solved. </p>
<p>In the Threads window, the icon to the left of the thread name indicates whether the thread
is suspended or waiting to be resumed.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
	<tr align="left" valign="top">
		<th scope="col">Icon</th>
		<th scope="col">Description</th>
	</tr>
        <tr valign="top">
		<td><img src="images/CurrentThread.gif" alt="Current thread"></td>
		<td>Indicates the current thread</td>
	</tr>
        <tr valign="top">
		<td><img src="images/RunningThread.gif" alt="Running thread"></td>
		<td>Indicates a thread that is running and is not current</td>
	</tr>
        <tr valign="top">
		<td><img src="images/SuspendedThread.gif" alt="Suspended thread"></td>
		<td>Indicates a thread that is suspended and is not current</td>
	</tr>
        </table>
        <p>You can display the Suspend property as a boolean flag (True or False) 
        in the Threads window by clicking the columns button 
        (<img src="images/ChangeColumn.gif" alt="Change Column">) and select the Suspend checkbox. </p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>  The state of the Thread is independent of whether the thread is suspended
  	or waiting to be resumed. A thread's state may be Running while the Suspend
  	property is True. </li>
  </ul>
<p><b>To suspend or resume a thread:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the thread in the Threads window and choose the Resume or Suspend command. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-threaded Applications</h3>
<p>When debugging a multi-threaded application, all threads are suspended when a breakpoint is hit 
(unless the breakpoint settings specifically are set to not suspend all threads).
When you then proceed to step through the application, all threads are resumed.
This behavior is desirable in some cases but not in others.</p>

<p>For example, when debugging a multi-threaded application, a step in one thread (<i>thread 1</i>) 
may be interrupted by a breakpoint encountered in another thread (<i>thread 2</i>).
You can control the threads that trigger breakpoints during the debugging session
in the Threads window.</p> 

<ol>
    <li>Start your debugging session.</li>
    <li>When the debugger encounters a breakpoint in <i>thread 1</i>, all threads in the program 
    are suspended and the program counter indicates the current breakpoint.</li>
    <li>Invoke a step in <i>thread 1</i> to resume all threads.<br>
    If a breakpoint is encountered in another thread <i>thread 2</i> before the step in <i>thread 1</i> is complete,
    all threads are suspended and the program counter indicates the current breakpoint in <i>thread 2</i>.
    <p>If you want to ignore breakpoints not on <i>thread 1</i>, do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the Threads window, click Ignore Breakpoint. Clicking this will cause the 
        debugger to ignore the specified breakpoint encountered in <i>thread 2</i> and you can continue to step
        through the program following <i>thread 1</i>.</li>
        <li>In the Threads window, click Ignore All Such Breakpoints.
        Clicking this will cause the debugger to ignore all breakpoints that do not occur on <i>thread 1</i>
        until the end of the debugging session.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Continue to step through your program.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Viewing Source Code for a Thread</h3>
<p>You can view the source code of a thread in the IDE's Source Editor if you
think it is causing problems and want to examine it further.</p> 
<p><b>To view a thread's source:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the thread in the Threads window and choose Go To Source. 
      <p> If the source of the thread is available, the Source Editor jumps to the 
      current call on the thread's call stack. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
