<h2>Debugging Threads in the IDE</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>All the threads created in the current session are displayed in the Debugging window.
  You can open the Debugging window by choosing Window  &gt; Debugging &gt; Debugging (Alt-Shift-9).</p>
  
<h3>Changing the Current Thread</h3>
<p> Only one thread is the current thread at any given time. By default, the
	current thread is the thread within the current session from which the debugger gained control. 
        When you switch between threads to debug, the Local Variables window is
        automatically updated to reflect the data applicable to that thread. </p>
        
<p><b>To change the current thread:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click any thread in the Debugging window to make it the current thread. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suspending and Resuming Threads</h3>
<p>You can suspend execution of a thread if you think it is causing problems
  and then later resume the thread once the problem is solved.
The Debugging window enables you to easily see the threads in the debugging session and 
identify the running and suspended threads.
The icon to the left of the thread name indicates whether the thread
is suspended or waiting to be resumed.</p>
<p>You can suspend, interrupt and resume application threads by right-clicking a thread
in the Debugging window and choosing an action from the popup menu.
Alternatively, you can click the  Resume (<img src="images/resume_button_16.png">&nbsp;) and Suspend 
(<img src="images/suspend_button_16.png">&nbsp;) buttons in the right side of the Debugging window. 
 You can hide the Suspend and Resume buttons by clicking the 
 Show suspend/resume table button (<img src="images/show_suspend_table_option_16.png" alt="Show suspend/resume table">&nbsp;)
 in the Debugging window toolbar.
</p>
    <ul class="note">
        <li>You can also resume and suspend threads in the Threads window.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Editor window icons</h3>
<p>A thread icon in the left margin of the source editor indicates that there is a suspended thread at that line.
    The following table describes the icons representing the thread states that 
    appear in the source editor during a debugging session.</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
            <tr align="left" valign="top">
                    <th scope="col">Icons</th>
                    <th scope="col">Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td align="center"><img src="images/other_threads_suspended.png" alt="Running thread"></td>
                    <td>Other suspended threads</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                    <td align="center"><img src="images/other_threads_breakpoint.png" alt="Thread suspended by breakpoint"></td>
                    <td>Other threads suspended by hitting a breakpoint</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        
        <p><b>To switch a suspended thread to the current thread:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the source editor, right-click the suspended thread icon and choose Set Current Thread To &gt; <i>new_current_thread</i>.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Multi-threaded Applications</h3>
    <p>When debugging a multi-threaded application, a step in a particular thread may be interrupted by
    a breakpoint encountered in some other thread.
    When this occurs the IDE gives you the option to switch threads.
    The IDE does not automatically switch the context to the new thread.</p>
    
    <p>When a breakpoint in another thread is hit you are notified by a panel that appears in the Debugging window.
    The current thread remains the current thread until you explicitly switch it or the thread stops.
    At any time you can click the arrow in the Debugging window and choose 
    a thread to switch to that thread.
    This enables you to continue debugging the current thread and then switching to the thread that hit
    a breakpoint when it is convenient.
    
    Alternatively, you can use the Current Thread Chooser (Ctrl-8) to select the thread you want to be the current thread.
    </p>

<p>Let us suppose you are stepping through a thread (<i>thread 1</i>), 
and one of the steps is interrupted by a breakpoint encountered in another thread (<i>thread 2</i>).
When this happens, the program counter is set to the breakpoint in <i>thread 2</i>.</p>

<p>You can continue stepping through your program in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Continue stepping through your program from the breakpoint in <i>thread 2</i>.</li>
    <li>Step through the program from the previous step (in <i>thread 1</i>) and ignore the breakpoint in <i>thread 2</i>.    
    <p>To continue with the step in <i>thread 1</i>, do one of the following in the Threads window: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Click Ignore Breakpoint.</b> Clicking this will cause the 
        debugger to ignore the specified breakpoint encountered in <i>thread 2</i> and you can continue to step
        through the program following <i>thread 1</i>.</li>
        <li><b>Click Ignore All Such Breakpoints.</b>
        Clicking this will cause the debugger to ignore all breakpoints that would interrupt a step in progress.
        If clicked, the IDE ignores such breakpoints until the end of the debugging session.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>


<h3>Viewing Source Code for a Thread</h3>
<p>You can view the source code of a thread in the IDE's Source Editor if you
think it is causing problems and want to examine it further.</p> 
<p><b>To view a thread's source:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the thread in the Threads window and choose Go To Source. 
      <p> If the source of the thread is available, the Source Editor jumps to the 
      current call on the thread's call stack. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
