<h2>Debugging Threads in the IDE</h2>
<small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> All the threads created in the current session are displayed in the Threads window.
  You can open the Threads window by choosing Window  &gt; Debugging &gt; Threads (Alt-Shift-7).</p>
  
<h3>Changing the Current Thread</h3>
<p> Only one thread is the current thread at any given time. By default, the
	current thread is the thread within the current session from which the debugger
	gained control. When you switch between threads to debug, the Call Stack and
	Local Variables windows are automatically updated to reflect the data applicable
	to that thread. </p>
        
<p><b>To change the current thread:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click any thread in the Threads window to make it the current thread. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Suspending and Resuming Threads</h3>
<p> You can suspend execution of a thread if you think it is causing problems
  and then later resume the thread once the problem is solved. </p>
<p>In the Threads window, the icon to the left of the thread name indicates whether the thread
is suspended or waiting to be resumed.<img src="images/CurrentThread.gif" alt="Current thread"> indicates
the current thread. <img src="images/RunningThread.gif" alt="Running thread"> indicates
a thread that is running and is not current, and <img src="images/SuspendedThread.gif" alt="Suspended thread">indicates
a thread that is suspended and is not current. You can  also display the Suspend
property as a boolean flag (True or False) in the Threads window by clicking
the columns button (<img src="images/ChangeColumn.gif" alt="Change Column" hspace="2">)
and select the Suspend checkbox. </p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>  The state of the Thread is independent of whether the thread is suspended
  	or waiting to be resumed. A thread's state may be Running while the Suspend
  	property is True. </li>
  </ul>
<p><b>To suspend or resume a thread:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the thread in the Threads window and choose the Resume or Suspend command. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing Source Code for a Thread</h3>
<p>You can view the source code of a thread in the IDE's Source Editor if you
	think it is causing problems and want to examine it further. 
<p><b>To view a thread's source:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the thread in the Threads window and choose Go To Source. 
    <p> If the source of the thread is available, the Source Editor jumps to the 
      current call on the thread's call stack. 
  </li>
