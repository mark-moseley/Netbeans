</small></p> 
<p>You can undo any changes that you made using the commands in the Refactor
  menu by following the steps below. When you undo a refactoring, the IDE rolls
	back all the changes in all the files that were affected by the refactoring.
  </p>
<p><b>To undo a refactoring command:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>If you have not already done so, open one of the files that was affected 
    by the refactoring in the Java Editor.</li>
  <li>Click anywhere in the file. </li>
  <li>Right-click and choose Refactor &gt; Undo from the contextual 
menu. <p>The IDE rolls 
  back all the changes in all the files that were affected by the refactoring.
  </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
<li>If any of the affected files have been modified since the refactoring took
	place, you must undo the newer changes first.</li></ul>
