        <h2>About Persistence Units</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>A persistence unit is required if you are using Java Persistence in your application.
    A persistence unit is a uniquely-named collection of properties that are used to determine 
        how a specific set of entities in an application are managed and persisted.</p>
        <p>Persistence units are defined in the <tt>persistence.xml</tt> file.
    You can have more than one persistence unit defined in <tt>persistence.xml</tt>, 
    but each persistence unit must have a unique name.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>Properties specified in a persistence unit include the following:</p>    
        <ul>
    <li>The entity classes within the <a href="#scope">scope of the persistence unit</a></li>
    <li>The <a href="#provide">persistence provider</a> or library used for managing the set of entities scoped by that persistence unit</li>
    <li>The <a href="#data">data source</a> used for the persistent storage of the managed entities</li>
    <li>The <a href="#trans">transaction type</a> the application uses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Persistence units can be packaged as part of a WAR or EJB-JAR file, 
        or can be packaged as a JAR file that can then be included in your application.</p>
        
        
        <a name="scope"></a>
        <h3>Scope of the Persistence Unit</h3>
        <p>
    The scope of a persistence unit is determined by the location of <tt>persistence.xml</tt>.
    When you use a wizard to create a persistence unit, the IDE creates <tt>persistence.xml</tt> in the location appropriate for the scope.
    For example, if you use the IDE to create a persistence unit for an EJB module, the IDE generates <tt>persistence.xml</tt> 
    in the <tt>src/conf</tt> directory of your EJB module.
    When the EJB JAR is built, it packages <tt>persistence.xml</tt> in the EJB JAR's <tt>META-INF</tt> directory.
    The scope of the persistence unit is the set of classes in the EJB JAR file.
        </p>
        <p>If the scope is not explicitly specified in a persistence unit, by default all the entities in the EJB JAR 
    file would be within the scope of the persistence unit defined in <tt>persistence.xml</tt>.</p>
        
       <p><b>Notes:</b></p> 
        <ul>
    <li>The location of <tt>persistence.xml</tt> determines the persistence root.
    The root of the persistence unit is the JAR file or directory that contains the <tt>META-INF</tt> directory containing <tt>persistence.xml</tt>. 
    </li>
         </ul>
             
         <a name="provide"></a>
             <h3>Persistence Provider</h3>    
             <p>A persistence provider refers to an implementation of the Java Persistence API.
             The persistence provider is a library that provides the functionality to persist objects in the application.</p>
    <p>The IDE is bundled with the TopLink Essentials persistence provider. 
    TopLink Essentials is the reference implementation and the default Java Persistence provider in the Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 9 and GlassFish.
    The TopLink Essentials persistence provider is a library consisting of <tt>toplink-essentials.jar</tt> and <tt>toplink-essentials-agent.jar</tt>.
    You can use TopLink Essentials as your provider, or specify a different persistence provider.
             </p>
             
             <a name="data"></a>
             <h3>Data Source</h3>    
             <p>A data source refers to the database where persistent entities are stored. 
    The data source must be registered on the server and is specified using the JNDI name.
    If the transactions are container-managed JTA transactions, the data source must be a JTA data source.
    If the transactions are application-managed, the data source is specified according to the JDBC database connection
    registered with the IDE.
             </p>
            <p>In Java SE environments, the database is specified either using a data source or by other means, 
            depending on the requirements of the persistence provider used.</p>
             
             <a name="trans"></a>
             <h3>Transaction Types</h3>
                <p>A persistence unit specifies how transactions are managed in the application.
    The transaction type you can use depends on the target container.
    If you are deploying to a Java EE container, transactions can be container-managed or application-managed.
    If you are not deploying to a Java EE container, transactions must be managed by the application.
                </p>
        <ul>
    <li><b>Container-managed transactions (JTA transactions).</b><br>
        Container-managed transactions are handled by the container using the Java Transaction API.
        To use the Java Transaction API, you must deploy your application to a Java EE container
        and your data source needs to support JTA transactions.
        <p>In <tt>persistence.xml</tt>, the transaction type for the persistence unit is set to <tt>JTA</tt>.
        If you are deploying to the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish, when you create the persistence unit this option is selected by default.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Application-managed transactions (resource-local transactions).</b><br>
        Application-managed transactions are handled by the application.
        <p>In <tt>persistence.xml</tt>, the transaction type for the persistence unit is set to <tt>RESOURCE_LOCAL</tt>.</p>
    </li>
        </ul>
