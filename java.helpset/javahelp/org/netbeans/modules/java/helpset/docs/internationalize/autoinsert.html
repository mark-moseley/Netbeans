<h2>Internationalizing a Single File</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The Internationalize dialog box enables you to replace hard-coded strings 
  in a single file with internationalized strings. If you need to internationalize 
  several Java sources into one or more resource bundles, use the Internationalization 
  wizard.</p>

<p>
<b>To internationalize source code:</b>

<!--NOTE : "automatically" was misleading, its not automatic (the wizard is more automatic)-->

<ol>
  <li>In the Files or Projects window, right-click the class file you want to
  	internationalize  and choose Tools  &gt; Internationalization 
     &gt; Internationalize. 
    <p>The Internationalize dialog box opens enabling you to edit each string
    	in the file consecutively.
    <ul><li>If a resource bundle already exists for the file, the 
      <tt>.properties</tt> file in which the strings are saved is displayed in
      the  Bundle Name field. The Replace String field also displays a preview
      of the  internationalized string.</li>
      <li>If no resource bundle exists for the file, the Bundle Name 
      and Replace String fields are empty. You can click the New button to create
      	a new  properties file in which to save internationalized strings. The <tt>.properties</tt> 
      suffix is added to the new file in the Files and Projects windows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
      
<li>
  	<p>If you want to choose a different <tt>.properties </tt>file, click Browse.</p>
  	</li>
  <!--PENDING : mention that .properties isn't visible if file extension visibility has been disabled?-->
<li>If you want to change the method used to generate the localized
	 string, click Format.</li>
  <li>If you want to add arguments to the method call, click Arguments. You
  	can only add arguments to the method call if you use the <tt>java.text.MessageFormat</tt> 
    or <tt>org.openide.util.NbBundle.getMessage</tt> formats.</li>
  <li>Check that the key and value are correct. By default, the Internationalize
  	 dialog box gives the key the same name as the string being replaced. </li>
    
<!--PENDING : point out that for a new bundle the key and value fields are filled in with the first string found in the file (maybe as a tip)-->
    
  <li>Click Replace to generate the internationalized string. 
    <p> The next string to be internationalized is then displayed in the Value
   text field. </p>  
  <li>Click Skip to ignore any strings you do not want to internationalize.
    	 <p>The IDE  automatically dismisses the dialog box once the last string has been
  		replaced.</p>
</ol>

  <ul class="note"> 
    <li>To get information about the highlighted string in the Source Editor, click 
  Info to see the name of the component containing the string and the property 
  that the string is associated with. </li>
  </ul>
