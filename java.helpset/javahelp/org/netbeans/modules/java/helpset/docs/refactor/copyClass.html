<h2>Copying a Class</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>


<p><b>To copy a class, either to the same or to another package, and to change the code that 
  references that class:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Projects window or the Source Editor window, right-click the class 
    and choose Refactor &gt; Copy from 
    the contextual menu. </li>
  <li>In the <a href="csh/copy-class_db.html">Copy Class dialog box</a>, select  
    the package from the To Package combo box or type 
    the fully qualified package name, such as <tt>com.myCom.myPkg</tt>.</li>
  <li>If you click Refactor, the IDE applies 
    the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps. If you click Preview,
    the Refactoring window displays the lines of code that will be changed. Review 
    the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. If the 
    class that you are pushing members from has multiple subclasses and you do not 
    want the members to be pushed to all of them, be sure to clear the checkboxes 
    for the corresponding subclasses. Click Do Refactoring to apply the selected changes.</li>
</li>
</ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can also initiate the copying of a class by dragging a class's node 
in the Projects window to another package's node or by cutting and pasting a class's node.
        </ul>


<p><b>To copy a class without doing refactoring:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Projects window, manually copy the class to another package. 
<p>You can cut and 
  paste the class, or you can use drag and drop.</p>
</li>
  <li>In the Copy Class dialog box, select the Copy Without Refactoring checkbox.</li>
  <li>Click Next.</li>
</ol>

    <ul class="note">
    <li>You should always perform a clean build after completing
    	any refactoring commands. You can do a clean build by right-clicking the project's 
    	node in the Projects window and choosing Clean and Build Project.
    </li>
  </ul>
