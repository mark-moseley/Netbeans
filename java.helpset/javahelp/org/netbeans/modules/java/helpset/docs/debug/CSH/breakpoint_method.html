<h2>Breakpoint Dialog Box: Method</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You use this dialog box to set the properties of an method breakpoint.</p>
<p>You can set method breakpoint properties when you set a new breakpoint or when modifying an
existing breakpoint.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To set a new method breakpoint, choose Run &gt; New Breakpoint 
    (Ctrl-Shift-F8) from the main menu, then select Method from the Breakpoint Type drop-down list.</li>
    <li>To customize an existing exception breakpoint, right-click the method breakpoint in the
    Breakpoints window and choose Customize.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
	<li>If the fields in the dialog box are already filled in, the information is based on the location of the insertion point in the Source Editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can set the following values:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Settings.</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Class Name.</b> The name of the class that contains the method. If the Apply Also to Anonymous Inner Classes checkbox is selected, the breakpoint also applies to all anonymous (unnamed) inner classes that the specified class contains. If an anonymous class contains another inner class (either anonymous or named), the breakpoint also applies to that inner class. </li>
                <li><b>All Methods for Given Class.</b> If selected, applies the breakpoint to all methods of the specified class. </li>
                <li><b>Method Name.</b> The name of the method in the class that triggers the breakpoint. 
                The All Methods for Given Class checkbox must be deselected to specify a method name.
                If you want to apply the breakpoint to all methods of the specified class, select the All Methods for Given Classes checkbox. </li>
                <li><b>Stop On.</b> Specifies when program execution is stopped. 
                Choose one of the criteria from the drop-down list.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Conditions</b>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Condition.</b> A Boolean expression that triggers the breakpoint when the expression evaluates to True. For information on the syntax rules for setting a condition, see <a href="../debug_syntaxrules_breakpointconditions.html">Syntax Rules for Setting a Condition on a Breakpoint</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Break when hit count.</b> When selected, enables you to specify how frequently the breakpoint is triggered. 
            Choose a criteria in the drop-down list and then specify a numerical value.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
	<li><b>Actions.</b> The actions to take when the breakpoint is triggered.
          <ul>
                <li><b>Suspend.</b> Specifies which threads in the program 
                being debugged are suspended when the breakpoint is reached. 
                You can specify no threads, all threads, or the breakpoint 
                thread. The breakpoint thread is the thread that is current 
                when the breakpoint is reached.</li>
                <li><b>Print Text.</b> The specified message is printed in the Debugger Console view of the Output window. For information on the tags you can include in the message, see 
                <a href="../debug_print_breakpoint_message.html">Printing a Breakpoint Message</a>.</li>
          </ul>
	</li>
</ul>
