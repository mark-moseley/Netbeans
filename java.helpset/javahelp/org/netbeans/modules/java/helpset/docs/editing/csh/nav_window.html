        <h2>Navigator Window (Java Projects)</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Navigator window provides a compact view of the currently selected file 
            and simplifies navigation between different parts of the file.</p>
        
        <p>For Java files, constructors, methods, and fields are displayed. You can 
            view these members either as a simple list or as an inheritance tree.</p>
        
        <p>For some kinds of XML files, you can use the Navigator to view the structure 
            of the file. The Navigator window works with standard XML documents, XML 
            schema files, and Ant scripts.</p>
        
        <p>You can open the Navigator window by choosing Window &gt; Navigator (Ctrl-7). 
            By default, the Navigator window opens in the lower left corner of the IDE. 
            To display a source file in the Navigator window, select the file in the Source 
            Editor, the Projects window, the Files window, or the Favorites window. Once
            a file is displayed, you can use the Navigator window to focus on a specific 
            nodes contained in the document. To do so, click on a given node in the Navigator 
            window, and your cursor automatically relocates to the node's position in the 
            document.</p>
        
        <h3>Java Files</h3>
        
        <p>When a Java file is selected, a drop-down list appears at the top of the 
            Navigator window to enable you to choose between the following two views:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Members view</strong>. Alphabetical listing of the selected source 
                file's members (constructors, methods, and fields).</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance view</strong>. Hierarchical tree view of the selected 
                source file's members.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can display the Javadoc documentation for a member by hovering the mouse 
            over the member's node.</p>
        
        <p>In the both the Members view and the Inheritance view, you can right-click a 
            node and choose the following command:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Go to Source</strong>. Opens the class in the Source Editor and 
                places the insertion point at the beginning of the constructor, method, 
                or field that the node represents.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In the Members view, you can also choose the following commands when you 
            right-click a node:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Javadoc</strong>. Generates missing standard Javadoc tags 
                for the selected member.</li>
            <li><strong>Sort by Name</strong>. Displays the members in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li><strong>Sort by Source</strong>. Displays the members in the order in 
                which they appear in the code.</li>
            <li><strong>Filters</strong>. Opens a submenu that enables you to select some 
                common filters for the types of members to display. You can select any 
                combination of the following filters:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show Inherited Members</strong>. Displays members that
                        come from classes that the current class extends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Fields</strong>. Displays the class's fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Static Members</strong>. Displays static fields 
                        and methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Non Public Members</strong>. Displays members that 
                        do not provide public access.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can also activate and disable filters using the buttons at the bottom of 
            the Navigator window.</p>
        
        <h3>XML Files</h3>
        
        <p>For XML files, the Navigator view displays a tree of elements.</p>
        
        <p>You can right-click an element node and choose the following options for the 
            level of detail to have displayed on the lines in the Navigator window:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Show Attributes</strong>. Displays the attributes of each element.</li>
            <li><strong>Show Content</strong>. Displays the text content of each element.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ant Build Scripts</h3>
        
        <p>When an Ant build script is selected, a drop-down list appears at the top of the 
            Navigator window to enable you to choose between the following two views:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ant Targets</strong>. Alphabetical listing of build targets.</li>
            <li><strong>XML View</strong>. Hierarchical tree view XML elements in the build 
                script.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When the Ant Targets view is selected, you can right-click a node and choose 
            one of the following commands:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open</strong>. Opens the file in the Source Editor and places 
                the insertion point at the beginning of the selected target's line.</li>
            <li><strong>Run Target</strong>. Runs the selected target.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="../../ant/ant_shortcut.html">Create Shortcut</a></strong>.

            <li><strong>Properties.</strong> Displays properties for the target in a
