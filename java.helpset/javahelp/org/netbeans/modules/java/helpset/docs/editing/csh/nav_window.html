        <h2>Navigator Window (Java Projects)</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Navigator window provides a compact view of the currently selected file 
            and simplifies navigation between different parts of the file.</p>
        
        <p>For Java files, you can see a list of constructors, methods, and fields.</p>
        
        <p>For some kinds of XML files, you can use the Navigator to view the structure 
            of the file. The Navigator window works with standard XML documents, XML 
            schema files, and Ant scripts.</p>
        
        <p>You can open the Navigator window by choosing Window &gt; Navigator (Ctrl-7). 
            By default, the Navigator window opens in the lower left corner of the IDE. 
            To display a source file in the Navigator window, select the file in the Source 
            Editor, the Projects window, the Files window, or the Favorites window. Once
            a file is displayed, you can use the Navigator window to focus on a specific 
            nodes contained in the document. To do so, click on a given node in the Navigator 
            window, and your cursor automatically relocates to the node's position in the 
            document.</p>
        
        <h3>Java Files</h3>
        
        <p>When a Java file is selected, a drop-down list appears at the top of the 
            Navigator window to enable you to choose between the following two views:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Members view</strong>. Alphabetical listing of the selected source 
                file's members (constructors, methods, and fields).</li>
            <li><strong>Bean Patterns</strong>. Listing of a class's bean properties 
            and event listeners.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>You can display the Javadoc documentation for a member by hovering the mouse 
            over the member's node.</p>
        
        <p>In the Members view, you can right-click a 
            node and choose the following commands:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Go to Source</strong>. Opens the class in the Source Editor and 
                places the insertion point at the beginning of the constructor, method, 
                or field that the node represents.</li>
            <li><strong>Sort by Name</strong>. Displays the members in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li><strong>Sort by Source</strong>. Displays the members in the order in 
                which they appear in the code.</li>
            <li><strong>Filters</strong>. Opens a submenu that enables you to select some 
                common filters for the types of members to display. You can select any 
                combination of the following filters:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Show Inherited Members</strong>. Displays members that
                        come from classes that the current class extends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Fields</strong>. Displays the class's fields.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Static Members</strong>. Displays static fields 
                        and methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Show Non Public Members</strong>. Displays members that 
                        do not provide public access.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can also activate and disable filters using the buttons at the bottom of 
            the Navigator window.</p>
        
        <h3>XML Files</h3>
        
        <p>For XML files, the Navigator view displays a tree of elements.</p>
        
        <p>You can right-click an element node and choose the following options for the 
            level of detail to have displayed on the lines in the Navigator window:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Show Attributes</strong>. Displays the attributes of each element.</li>
            <li><strong>Show Content</strong>. Displays the text content of each element.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ant Build Scripts</h3>
        
        <p>When an Ant build script is selected, a drop-down list appears at the top of the 
            Navigator window to enable you to choose between the following two views:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ant Targets</strong>. Alphabetical listing of build targets.</li>
            <li><strong>XML View</strong>. Hierarchical tree view XML elements in the build 
                script.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When the Ant Targets view is selected, you can right-click a node and choose 
            one of the following commands:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open</strong>. Opens the file in the Source Editor and places 
                the insertion point at the beginning of the selected target's line.</li>
            <li><strong>Run Target</strong>. Runs the selected target.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="../../ant/ant_shortcut.html">Create Shortcut</a></strong>. 
                Opens a wizard that enables you to create a menu item, a toolbar item, 
                a keyboard shortcut, and custom code for running the target.</li>
            <li><strong>Properties.</strong> Displays properties for the target in a 
                property sheet. These properties are not editable.</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <p>When XML View is selected, you can right-click a node and choose one of the 
            following options for the level of detail to have displayed:</p>
        
        <ul>
