        <h2>Customize Code Dialog Box (Swing GUI Builder)</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        <p>The Customize Code dialog box enables you to customize the way that 
        code is generated for a component in the GUI Builder and to insert custom code within the 
        GUI Builder's guarded blocks.
        You open the Customize Code dialog box box by right-clicking 
         a component in the GUI Builder and choosing Customize Code.</p>
         <p>In the Initialization Code section of the dialog box, you can 
         type code before and after the generated initialization and creation code.</p>
         <p>You can also replace a section of the generated code with 
         your own custom code. Select a custom option from the 
         drop-down list next to the section of code. Then type your custom code 
         in place of the generated code.</p>
         <p>In addition, you can set the way the variable is generated for the 
         component.</p>
<ul class="note">
<li>You can also customize code for specific properties by clicking the ellipsis (...) button
in the property sheet for a component. Customizing code this way in the property 
sheet has the advantage of more closely associating the custom code with the property, 
which makes the code easier to maintain.</li>
        </ul>
