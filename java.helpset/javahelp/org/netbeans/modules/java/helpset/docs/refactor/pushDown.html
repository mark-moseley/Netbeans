    <h2>Moving a Class Member to a Subclass</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

    <p>You can use the Push Down command to move inner classes, methods, fields to a subclass of 
    their current class.</p>
    <p><b>To initiate the Push Down operation:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Source Editor or Projects window, select the class member or class members 
        that you want to move.</li>
        <li>Choose Refactor &gt; Push Down.
        <p>The Push Down dialog box appears and displays a list of the class's members. Make sure the checkbox 
        for the member that you want to move is selected.</p></li>
        <li>(Optional) Select the Keep Abstract checkbox 
            for any abstract methods that you want to keep defined in the current class 
            and have implemented in the subclass. The checkbox in the left column 
            must also be checked for the class definition to be copied to the subclass.
        </li>
        <li>If you click Refactor, the IDE applies 
    the changes automatically and skips the remaining steps. If you click Preview,
    the Refactoring window displays the lines of code that will be changed. Review 
    the list and clear the checkbox of any code that you do not want changed. If the 
    class that you are pushing members from has multiple subclasses and you do not 
    want the members to be pushed to all of them, be sure to clear the checkboxes 
    for the corresponding subclasses. Click Do Refactoring to apply the selected changes.</li>
    </ol>
