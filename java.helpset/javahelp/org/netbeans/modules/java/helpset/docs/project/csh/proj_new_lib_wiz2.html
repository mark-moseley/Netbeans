<h2>New Libraries Wizard: Actions</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>The New Libraries wizard enables you to set a folder to hold 
your Java classpath libraries or to hold references to those libraries. 
Setting a libraries folder makes it easier to 
<a href="../proj_sharing.html">share libraries</a> among different 
users and projects. You open the New Libraries wizard 
by right-clicking a standard project's 
&nbsp;node, choosing Properties, selecting the Libraries panel, and clicking Browse. 

<p>On the Actions page, you determine how each library is referenced. 
The simplest case is to have the libraries copied to that folder. 
You can also refer to the libraries in their existing location 
(with a relative path or an absolute path). If you have specified an existing folder, 
you also have the option of using copies of libraries that are already in that folder 
instead of the copies that are contained in the IDE's Library Manager. For each 
library, the wizard tries to select the most suitable action.</p>

            <p>The following actions are available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Copy Library JAR Files to New Libraries Folder.</b>  
                    Use this option if the library is not in the  
                    folder that you have selected and you want to have the 
                    library JAR files placed there. </li>
                <li><b>Use Relative Path to Library JAR Files.</b>   
                    Use this option if the library is not in the libraries 
                    folder and you need to access the library in its existing location using 
                    a relative path. An entry with a relative reference is added 
                for the library in the libraries folder's <tt>nblibraries.properties</tt> file.</li>
                <li><b>Use Absolute Path to Library JAR Files.</b>    
                    Use this option if the library is not in the libraries 
                    folder and you need to access the library in its existing location using 
                    an absolute path. An entry with an absolute reference is added 
                for the library in the libraries folder's <tt>nblibraries.properties</tt> file.</li>
                <li><b>Use Existing Library in Libraries Folder.</b> 
                    Use this option if there is already a copy of the library in 
                    the libraries folder and you want to use that copy of the 
                library.</li>
        </ul>
