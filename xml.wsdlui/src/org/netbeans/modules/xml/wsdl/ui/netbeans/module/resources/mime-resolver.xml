        <!-- if we use text/*xml mime type then data editor support
        automatically recognize this mime type and show xml editor
        but there is another mime resolver registered with web svc module
        which has text/xml-wsdl as mime type and even though
        we install out wsdl editor data object before their data object
        it still picks mime resolver registered by web servc module
        so work around is to use same mime resolver as websvc
        we need to ask them to disable mime resolver there-->
