<h2>Views in the WSDL Editor</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The WSDL Editor provides a <a href="#wsdleditorsourceview">Source view</a> and a <a href="#wsdleditorwsdlview">WSDL view</a>. 
The WSDL Editor toolbar has two buttons that you can use to access the different views: Source and WSDL.</p>
<h3><a name="wsdleditorsourceview"></a>Source View</h3>
<p>In the Source view, the underlying XML source code appears. You can directly edit the XML.</p>
<p>The top of the Source Editor has a tab for each open document. 
  Each tab shows the name of the document. 
  If the document has been modified and has not been saved, then an asterisk (*) appears after the name. 
  You can right-click a tab to access various commands.</p>
<p>A toolbar is located at the top of the Source Editor window.</p>
<p>Source code displayed in the Source Editor is syntactically colored.</p>
<p>The Source Editor status line is located beneath the horizontal scroll bar. 
  To toggle between insert mode and overwrite mode, use the Insert key.</p>
<h3><a name="wsdleditorwsdlview"></a>WSDL View</h3>
<p>In the WSDL view, you use GUI components to configure the elements and attributes of the WSDL file.</p>
<p>The WSDL view has two subviews: tree view and column view. 
  To switch between the subviews, use the buttons in the WSDL Editor toolbar.</p>
<p>Some component nodes allow you to add extension attributes. 
  In the Add Extension Attribute dialog box, you can specify the name and namespace. 
  Once you add the attribute, you can specify the value from the Properties window. 
  These component nodes also allow you to remove extension attributes.</p>
<p>If you right-click a component node and choose Go To Source, 
  then the Source view appears with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the component's block.</p>
<p>You can perform <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.bpel.bpelhelp/org/netbeans/modules/bpel/bpelhelp/design/refactoring.html" 
title="Refactoring in BPEL Processes">refactoring</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you right-click a component node and choose Find Usages, 
    then the IDE shows which components use the component that you selected.</li>
  <li>If you right-click a component node and choose Refactor &gt; Rename, 
    then you can rename all occurrences in the associated XSD, WSDL, and BPEL files.</li>
  <li>If you right-click a component node and choose Refactor &gt; Safely Delete, 
    then you can check for references to the component before you perform the delete.</li>
  </ul>
<p>You can also rename a component by changing the value of the Name property. The WSDL Editor renames all occurrences in the same file, but not in other files.</p>
