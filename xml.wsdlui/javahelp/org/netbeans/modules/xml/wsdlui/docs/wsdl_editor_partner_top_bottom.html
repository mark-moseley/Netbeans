<h2>Understanding the Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Partner view of the WSDL Editor supports the top-down and bottom-up approaches to creating a WSDL file.</p>

<p>The top-down approach consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a partner link type. 
    The partner link type contains a default role, which appears on the right. 
    If you want to define a peer-to-peer interaction, then you must add a second role on the left.</li>
  <li>Create the messages that will be sent from one partner to another.</li>
  <li>Assign the messages to the partner link type's operations.</li>
  <li>Specify the data types for the messages. 
    Note that you can create or import an XML schema by using the Navigator window, 
    and then drag the schema elements or types into the messages.</li>
</ol>

<p>The bottom-up approach consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create or import an XML schema by using the Navigator window.</li>
  <li>Create the messages that will be sent from one partner to another. 
    Note that you can drag the schema elements or types from the Navigator window into the messages.</li>
  <li>Create a partner link type. 
    The partner link type contains a default role, which appears on the right. 
    If you want to define a peer-to-peer interaction, then you must add a second role on the left.</li>
  <li>Assign the messages to the partner link type's operations.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are building a composite application, then you can use the 
Composite Application Service Assembly (CASA) editor to configure the concrete bindings in the WSDL file. 
This approach prevents the WSDL file from being tied to a particular binding.</p>
