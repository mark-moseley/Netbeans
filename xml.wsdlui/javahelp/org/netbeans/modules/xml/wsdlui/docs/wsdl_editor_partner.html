<h2>About the Partner View</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>In the Partner view of the WSDL Editor, you can visualize and configure the abstract elements in a WSDL file. 
The abstract elements include partner link types, port types, operations, and messages.</p>

<p>A <i>partner link type</i> characterizes the conversational relationship between two services. 
  A partner link type can have one or two roles. 
  A role describes the function that a service has in the relationship. 
  Examples of roles are <tt>loanRequestor</tt> and <tt>loanProcessor</tt>. 
  Each role must specify the port type that the service will use to receive messages.</p>

<p>The Partner view helps you to visualize the following types of interactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Client/Server.</b> In this interaction, the partner link type has one role. The role represents the server. 
    The server can be invoked by one or more unspecified clients.</li>
  <li><b>Peer to Peer.</b> In this interaction, the partner link type has two roles. Each role represents a peer service.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Partner view supports the top-down and bottom-up approaches to creating a WSDL file.</p>

<p>The top-down approach consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a partner link type. 
    The partner link type contains a default role, which appears on the right. 
    If you want to define a peer-to-peer interaction, then you must add a second role on the left.</li>
  <li>Create the messages that will be sent from one partner to another.</li>
  <li>Assign the messages to the partner link type's operations.</li>
  <li>Specify the data types for the messages. 
    Note that you can create or import an XML schema by using the Navigator window, 
    and then drag the schema elements or types into the messages.</li>
</ol>

<p>The bottom-up approach consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create or import an XML schema by using the Navigator window.</li>
  <li>Create the messages that will be sent from one partner to another. 
    Note that you can drag the schema elements or types from the Navigator window into the messages.</li>
  <li>Create a partner link type. 
    The partner link type contains a default role, which appears on the right. 
    If you want to define a peer-to-peer interaction, then you must add a second role on the left.</li>
  <li>Assign the messages to the partner link type's operations.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are building a composite application, then you can use the 
Composite Application Service Assembly (CASA) editor to configure the concrete bindings in the WSDL file. 
This approach prevents the WSDL file from being tied to a particular binding.</p>

<p>The Partner view has the following components:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Toolbar.</b> The toolbar is located at the top of the view, just below the tab for the WSDL file.</li>
  <li><b>PartnerLinkTypes box.</b> This box contains one configuration box for each partner link type in the WSDL file.</li>
  <li><b>Messages box.</b> This box contains one configuration box for each message in the WSDL file.</li>
  <li><b>Palette.</b> The Palette contains partner link type, operation, and message icons that you can drag into the configuration boxes. 
    To display the Palette, choose Window &gt; Palette from the IDE's main menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can expand or collapse the boxes. When a box is collapsed, click the downward arrow to expand the box. When a box is expanded, click the upward arrow to collapse the box.</p>

<p>You can print the contents of the Partner view by using the IDE's standard print feature.</p>

<p>After performing an action in the Partner view, you can reverse the action by choosing Edit &gt; Undo (Ctrl-Z) from the IDE's main menu.</p>

<p>You can reverse an undo command by choosing Edit &gt; Redo (Ctrl-Y) from the IDE's main menu.</p>

<p>If you right-click a component and choose Go To &gt; Source, 
  then the Source view appears with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the component's block.</p>
