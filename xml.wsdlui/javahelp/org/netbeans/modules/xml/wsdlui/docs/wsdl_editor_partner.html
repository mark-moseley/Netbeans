<h2>About the Partner View</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>In the Partner view of the WSDL Editor, you can visualize and configure the abstract elements in a WSDL file. 
The abstract elements include partner link types, port types, operations, and messages.</p>

<p>A <i>partner link type</i> characterizes the conversational relationship between two services. 
  A partner link type can have one role or two roles. 
  A role describes the function that a service has in the relationship. 
  Examples of roles are <tt>loanRequestor</tt> and <tt>loanProcessor</tt>. 
  A role must specify the port type that the service will use to receive messages.</p>

<p>The Partner view helps you to visualize the following types of interactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Client/Server.</b> In this type of interaction, the partner link type has one role. The role represents the server. 
    The server can be invoked by one or more unspecified clients.</li>
  <li><b>Peer to Peer.</b> In this type of interaction, the partner link type has two roles. Each role represents a peer service.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Partner view supports the <a href="wsdl_editor_partner_top_bottom.html">top-down and bottom-up approaches</a> to creating a WSDL file.</p>

<p>You can print the contents of the Partner view by using the IDE's standard print feature.</p>

<p>After performing an action in the Partner view, you can reverse the action by choosing Edit &gt; Undo (Ctrl-Z) from the IDE's main menu. 
You can reverse an undo command by choosing Edit &gt; Redo (Ctrl-Y) from the IDE's main menu.</p>

<p>If you right-click a component and choose Go To &gt; Source, 
  then the Source view appears with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the component's block.</p>
