<h2>New WSDL Document Wizard: Concrete Configuration</h2>

<p>The Concrete Configuration page of the New WSDL Document wizard prompts you to supply information about the 
following elements of the WSDL file: binding, service, and port. </p>

<p>A <i>binding</i> contains protocol and data format information 
for the operations and messages of a port type.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Binding Name.</b> Supply a name for the binding. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>
  <li><b>Binding Type.</b> Use this field to customize the WSDL file for a particular binding component. 
  The appropriate extensibility elements will be added to the WSDL file. </li>
  <li><b>Binding Subtype.</b> If the binding type is SOAP, then the binding subtypes indicate how to translate 
  the binding to a SOAP message. For other binding types, you typically have only one choice for the binding subtype.</li>
</ul>

<p>The wizard checks for comformance to various requirements of the 
  Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) Basic Profile. 
  These requirements concern the interaction of message parts and the binding subtype. 
  If your settings for message parts and the binding subtype do not conform to these requirements, 
  then an error message appears at the bottom of the wizard page and the Finish button is disabled.</p>

<p>A <i>service</i> consists of one or more related ports. 
Each <i>port</i> associates a binding with a network address, thus defining an individual endpoint that clients can access.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Service Name.</b> Supply a name for the service. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>
  <li><b>Port Name.</b> Supply a name for the port. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you click Finish, the WSDL file is created. The WSDL Editor appears in WSDL view. 
  The tree structure includes nodes for the port type, operation, message(s), binding, service, and port 
  that you specified in the wizard.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>If you selected the SOAP binding type, then the port's <tt>soap:address</tt> node includes a Location property.
    The Location property specifies the address of the port. 
    The wizard generates a dummy value for the Location property. 
    The Location property must be unique; that is, the value must not conflict with any other WSDL files 
    that are deployed to the same application server.</li>
</ul>
