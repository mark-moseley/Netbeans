<h2>New WSDL Document Wizard: Concrete Configuration</h2>
<p>The Concrete Configuration page of the New WSDL Document wizard prompts you to supply information about the 
following elements of the WSDL file: binding, service, and port. </p>
<p>A binding defines message format and protocol details for a port type.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Binding Name.</b> Supply a name for the binding. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>
  <li><b>Binding Type.</b> The only supported binding type in this release is the SOAP protocol.</li>
  <li><b>Binding Subtype.</b> The options indicate how to translate the binding to a SOAP message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The wizard checks for comformance to various requirements of the 
  Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I) Basic Profile. 
  These requirements concern the interaction of message parts and the binding subtype. 
  If your settings for message parts and the binding subtype do not conform to these requirements, 
  an error message appears at the bottom of the wizard page and the Finish button is disabled.</p>
<p>A service indicates which binding to use and where clients can access the web service. 
  A port contains the address.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Service Name.</b> Supply a name for the service. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>
  <li><b>Port Name.</b> Supply a name for the port. The default value is derived from the WSDL name.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you click Finish, the WSDL file is created. The WSDL Editor appears in WSDL view. 
  The tree structure includes nodes for the port type, operation, message(s), binding, service, and port 
  that you specified in the wizard.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>The port's SOAP address node includes a location property, which specifies the address of the port. 
    The wizard generates a dummy value for the location property. 
    The location property must be unique; that is, the value must not conflict with any other WSDL files 
    that are deployed to the same application server.</li>
</ul>
