               Localization Demo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

    Localization is the process of designing software so that it can be adapted 
    (localized) to various languages and regions without engineering changes 
    to the software. When you localize an application, you provide alternate 
    language values for each element in your application, such as screen text, 
    menus, and icons.


2. Usage

    *Choose the active configuration of your project. There are 3 ways to do it:
      1. Use the configuration combobox in main toolbar
      2. Change the selected project configuration in Project Properties dialog
      3. Choose Set Active Project Configuration from the Configuration popup menu 
         in your project node.
            
    * Run the LocalizationDemo project.

    * Both the MIDlets in the project provide the same functionality. The difference
      is one is created with the Visual Mobile Designer and the other one is a plain MIDlet.
