<h2>About the IEP Operator Palette and Design View </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can use the IEP Operator Palette and Design View to graphically establish the operator flow when using the IEP. The IEP enables you to compose event processors by dragging operators from the operator palette, configuring each operator using the NetBeans' property sheet or its custom property editor, and connecting operators through their input/output ports.</p>
<p>The Palette is made up of the following sections.</p>
