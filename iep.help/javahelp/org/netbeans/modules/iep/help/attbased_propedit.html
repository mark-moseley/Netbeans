<p><strong>To create an Attribute Based Window operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag an Attribute Based Window operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Click the Attribute Based Window operator icon. The Property Window opens with the name of the Attribute Based Window operator and the output schema name populated. The Property Window displays the schema of the data that is input to the Attribute Based Window operator. </li>
