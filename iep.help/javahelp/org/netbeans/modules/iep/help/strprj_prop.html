<h2>Using the Stream  Projection and Filter Operator Property Window </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Stream and Project Filter operator enables you to obtain a stream and for each event in the input stream, make the event bigger by adding new attributes, or make the events smaller by eliminating attributes, or rename attributes. You can also join an existing set of events with one or more static tables, in which case the output stream can have a different schema than the input stream's schema.  For example, you have information relating to an existing stock and its price, but you want to join a static SEC table to provide CEO and company size information--you are, in effect, adding a new dimension to the set of events in the input stream</p>
<p>When you add or remove dimensions to an event; you are using the operator to provide a filtering capability on attributes to add or remove attributes.For example, you have information on a company that includes stock symbol and price but you want to filter out one of these.To do, you can use the Stream Projection and Filter Operator. </p>
