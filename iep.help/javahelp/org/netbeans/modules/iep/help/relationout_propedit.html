It sends out records with a tag on the end which indicates&nbsp; + or -&nbsp; (records added or deleted, respectively.) </p><p> However, if a triggering event enters into the IEP process, but the result of the final Relation from that event does not change,&nbsp; the relation output is not triggered.&nbsp;</p><p>If a change occurs as a result of the triggering event such that a record changes, a delete record is sent out matching the changed record.&nbsp; An add record is sent out when there is an updated or new version of that record.&nbsp;The operator only sends out change events rather than the entire result time after time.&nbsp;<br>For example, if a change occurs which results in a new record,&nbsp; only an add record is sent out.&nbsp; Again, if the new result is that only three records no longer appear,&nbsp; three delete records are sent out. </p><p>The Attribute fields in the Relation Output are supplied by the input that the operator receives. </p><p><strong>To create a Relation Output operator. </strong></p><ol>  <li>Drag a Relation Output  operator to the Design view.</li>  <li>Click the Relation Output  operator icon. </li>  <li>Click the Include Timestamp checkbox if you want to include a timestamp on the output from the Relation Output.</li>  <li>Click Ok.</li></ol><dl><dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd><dd><a href="tableout_propedit.html">Using the Table Output Operator Property Editor </a></dd><dd>&nbsp;</dd><dd><a href="streamout_propedit.html">Using the Stream Output Operator Property Editor </a></dd><dd>&nbsp; </dd></dl><hr><small><a href="credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small><table cellpadding="150" border="0"> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> </table> </body></html>
