Whenever a event triggers a change in the relation result, it sends out records with a tag on the end, which indicate a + or - (records added or deleted, respectively.) </p><p>If a change occurs as a result of the triggering event such that a record changes, the IEP sends a delete record matching the changed record. The IEP feature sends an add record ut when there is an updated or new version of that record. The operator only sends out change events rather than repeatedly sending the entire result.</p><p> However, if a triggering event enters into the IEP process, but the result of the final Relation from that event does not change,&nbsp; the relation output is not triggered and no data is sent from the IEP feature.</p><p><strong>To create a Relation Output operator:</strong></p><ol>  <li>Drag a Relation Output  operator to the Design view.</li>  <li>Click the Relation Output  operator icon. </li>  <li>Click the Include Timestamp checkbox if you want to include a timestamp on the output from the Relation Output.</li>  <li>Click Ok.</li></ol><dl><dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd><dd><a href="tableout_propedit.html">Using the Table Output Operator Property Editor </a></dd><dd>&nbsp;</dd><dd><a href="streamout_propedit.html">Using the Stream Output Operator Property Editor </a></dd><dd>&nbsp; </dd></dl><hr><small><a href="credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small><table cellpadding="150" border="0"> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> </table> </body></html>
