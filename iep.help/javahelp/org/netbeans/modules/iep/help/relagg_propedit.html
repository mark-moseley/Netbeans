<h2>Using the Relation Aggregator Property Editor </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Use the Relation Aggregator operator to take as input the output of a relation, treat that output as if it were a database table, and perform an SQL Select on that table. The Relation operator issues output in the form of a relation.</p>
<p><strong>To create a Relation Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Relation Aggregator operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Click the Relation Aggregator operator icon. The Property Window opens with the name of the Distinct operator and the output schema name populated. The Property Window displays the schema of the data that is input to the Distinct operator. </li>
  <li>In the Select field, specify attributes from which to select. Any attribute you specify here must appear in the group-by clause. Attributes you select as expression entries must be in the form of an attribute name, a literal, or an aggregate function supported by the database you use.</li>
  <li>In the Expression field, provide a SQL expression to further delimit your Select statement.</li>
  <li>Optionally specify a Where statement in the Where field to provide a search condition, which cannot have a subquery.</li>
  <li>In the group by field, specify  a comma-separated list of attribute names, indicating how you want to group the attributes in the relation that is output from this operator.</li>
  <li>Click Ok.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To define the SQL statements to use with a Tuple Based Aggregator operator:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Expression box, enter the expression for the SQL Select statement which is used to specify the input attribute upon which the Select is performed. Add atrribute names, data types. and sizes, as applicable.  Note that any atrribute specified here must appear in the group-by clause.</li>
  <li>In the From field, define the input on which to perform the selection. <span class="bold"></span></li>
  <li>In the Where clause field, provide additional search criteria. </li>
  <li>In the Group by box, provide a comma-separated list of attribute names. </li>
  </li>
</ol>
