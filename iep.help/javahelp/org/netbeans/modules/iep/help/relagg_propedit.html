<h2>Using the Relation Aggregator Operator Property Editor </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Use the Relation Aggregator operator to take as input the output of a relation, treat that output as if it were a database table, and perform an SQL Select on that table. The Relation operator issues output in the form of a relation.</p>
<p><strong>To create a Relation Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Relation Aggregator operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Click the Relation Aggregator operator icon. The Property Window opens with the default name of the Relation Aggregator operator and the output schema name populated. The Property Window displays the schema of the data that is input to the Distinct operator. </li>
  <li>In the Select field, specify attributes from which to select. Any attribute you specify here must appear in the group-by clause. Attributes you select as expression entries must be in the form of an attribute name, a literal, or an aggregate function supported by the database you use. Examples include COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG. </li>
  <li>In the Expression field, provide a SQL expression to further delimit your Select statement. To save some typing, you can drag input attribute field names from the Inputs area into the Expression field. </li>
  <li>Optionally specify a Where statement in the Where field to provide a search condition, which cannot have a subquery.</li>
  <li>In the group by field, specify  a comma-separated list of attribute names, indicating how you want to group the attributes in the relation that is output from this operator.</li>
  <li>Click Ok.
  </li>
</li>
</ol>
