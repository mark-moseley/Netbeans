<h2>Using the Tuple Based Aggregator Operator Property Window </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> The Tuple Based Aggregator operator performs statistical analysis for a specified number of records that you  provide as a Size, and for an Increment that indicates how often you want the operation performed.</p>
<p> For example, provided a stream of stock transactions, the Tuple Based Aggregator operator  computes a new stream that holds the minimum, average, and maximum of the stock price of every 10 transactions, in which the Size is 10.</p>
<p>Statistics you can compute via SQL statements within the Property Editor of the Tuple Based Aggregator include:</p>
<ul><li>Sum</li>
  <li>Average</li>
  <li>Minimum</li>
  <li>Maximum</li>
  <li>COUNT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create a Tuple Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Tuple Based Aggregation operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Click the Tuple Based Aggregation operator icon.The Property Editor opens. </li>
  <li>In the Start field, enter  the record in which you want the operator calculations to begin.</li>
  <li>In the Increment field, enter how often you want the analysis performed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To define the SQL statements to use with a Time Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Expression box enter the expression for the SQL Select statement which is used to specify the input attribute upon which the Select is performed. </li>
  <li>In the From box, define the input on which to perform the selection. <span class="bold"></span></li>
  <li>In the Where clause box, provide additional filtering on records, for example, <tt>WHERE price &gt; 30.00 AND stockDate &lt; '2006-01-01' </tt>; </li>
  <li>In the Group by box, group a result into subsets that have matching values for one or more columns of the database by specifying a comma separated list of qualified attribute names.</li>
