For example, provided a stream of stock transactions, the operator can compute a new stream that holds the minimum, average, and maximum of the stock price of every 10 transactions.</p><p>Statistics you can compute via SQL statements within the Proeprty Editor of the Tuple Based Aggregator include:</p><ul><li>Sum</li>  <li>Average</li>  <li>Median</li>  <li>Lower-quantile</li>  <li>Upper-quantile</li>  <li>Minimum</li>  <li>Maximum</li>  <li>Standard-deviation</li>  <li> Sum-of-square</li>  <li>Outlier-percentage</li></ul><p><strong>To create a Tuple Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p><ol>  <li>Drag a Tuple Based Aggregation operator from the Palette to the Design area.</li>  <li>Click the Tuple Based Aggregation operator icon.The Property Editor opens. </li>  <li>In the Start field, enter  the record in which you want the operator calculations to begin.</li>  <li>In the Increment field, enter how often you want the analysis performed.</li></ol><p><strong>To define the SQL statements to use with a Time Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p><ol>  <li>In the Expression box enter the expression for the SQL Select statement which is used to specify the input attribute upon which the Select is performed. </li>  <li>In the From box, define the input on which to perform the selection. <span class="bold"></span></li>  <li>In the Where clause box, provide additional filtering on records, for example, <tt>WHERE price &gt; 30.00 AND stockDate &lt; '2006-01-01' </tt>; </li>  <li>In the Group by box, group a result into subsets that have matching values for one or more columns of the database by specifying a comma separated list of qualified attribute names.</li>  </ol><dl><dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt><dd>&nbsp;</dd><dd><a href="timebased_propedit.html">Using the Time Based Aggregator Operator Property Editor </a></dd></dl><hr><small><a href="credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small><table cellpadding="150" border="0"> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> </table> </body></html>
