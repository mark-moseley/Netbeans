The order subtraction is determined by the order in which you connect the input relations. You cannot subtract unlike operator attributes.</p><p><strong>To create a Minus operator:</strong></p><ol>  <li>Drag a Minus operator to the Design view.</li>  <li>Click the Minus operator icon.</li>  <li>In the Subtract From dialog box, specify the preceding operator from which the subtraction operation is to be performed. To find the order of the subtraction, open the properties pane for the Minus operator. The input list id tells you the order of the operators that are subtracted by this Minus operator. Next, open the properties pane for the relations feeding into the Minus operator, and look at their ID.</li>  <li>In the Expression dialog box, choose the appropriate provided subtraction operation based on the prior operators in your process. </li>  <li>Change the order in the Expression dialog box if and as necessary. <br>  As with other operators, you can specify multiple input streams to a minus operation, and provide filters before the Minus operator.</li>  <li>The Size box will indicate the number of records to retain, based on the prior specification of an operator, such as Tuple Based window.</li></ol><dl><dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt><dd><a href="tuplebased_propedit.html">Using the Tuple Based Window Operator Property Editor </a></dd><dd><a href="intersect_propedit.html">Using the Intersect Operator Property Editor </a></dd><dd><a href="distinct_propedit.html">Using the Distinct Operator Property Editor</a></dd><dd><a href="timebased_propedit.html"> </a><a href="union_propedit.html">Using the Union Operator Property Editor</a></dd><dd><a href="timebased_propedit.html"> </a><a href="unionall_propedit.html">Using the Union All Operator Property Editor </a></dd><dd>&nbsp;</dd></dl><hr><small><a href="credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small><table cellpadding="150" border="0"> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> </table> </body></html>
