<h2>Using the Minus Operator Property Editor </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Minus Operator subtracts one stream from another. The order of subtraction is determined by the order in which you connect the input relations. You cannot subtract unlike operator attributes. The input schemas must be identical, with identical names and types for all attributes.</p>
<p><strong>To create a Minus operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Minus operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Connect two or more input relations. </li>
  <li>Click the Minus operator icon. The property editor opens. <br>
  The Expression field provides the order of the minus expression. This is initially determined by the order in which the inputs were connected. You can determine this by opening the properties pane for the Minus operator.The input ID list provides the order of the operators that the Minus operator subtracts Next. Open the properties pane for the relations feeding into the Minus operator and examine their ID.</li>
  <li>To change the order in the Expression dialog box, select the Order by drop down list, and a new primary operator. The new primary operator becomes the first operator on the Expression field. <br>
  You can connect additional inputs to the Minus operator at a later time.<br>
  You can also remove inputs. When you do so, the Expression is automatically updated.</li>
