Operators can be categorized by their input and output:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Stream to relation</strong>. Operators that take a stream as input, and produce a relation as output with the same schema as the stream.</li>  <li><strong>Relation to stream.</strong> Operators that take a relation as input, and produce a stream as output with the same schema as the relation.</li>  <li><strong>Relation to relation.</strong> Operators that take one or more relations as input and produce a relation as output.</li>  <li><strong>Stream to stream</strong>. Operators that take a stream as input, and produce a stream as output. The input stream and the output scheme can have different schemas.</li>  <li><strong>Relation-to-table</strong>. Operators that take a relation as input, and produce a table as output.</li></ul><p>You can also think of operators as performing functions in the following manner.</p><ul>  <li> <strong>Input</strong>. Inputs data to other operators in a process.</li>  <li><strong>Output</strong>. Receives data from other operators in a process.</li>  <li><strong>Correlation and Filter</strong>. Correlation enables you to obtain data based on the relationship of two pieces of existing data. Filtering enables you to provide information to obtain a subset of data you want.</li>  <li><strong>Aggregator.</strong> Aggregates or summarizes data.</li>  <li><strong>Stream Converter.</strong> Converts stream data to a relation.</li>  <li><strong>Relation Converter.</strong> Converts a relation to a stream or table.</li>  <li><strong>Relation Operator.</strong> Performs operations on a relation.</li></ul><dl><dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt><dd><a href="about_openv.html">About the Operator Environment </a><a href="unionall_propedit.html"></a></dd><dd>&nbsp;</dd></dl><hr><small><a href="credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small><table cellpadding="150" border="0"> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> </table> </body></html>
