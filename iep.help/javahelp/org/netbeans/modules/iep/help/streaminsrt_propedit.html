<h2>Using the Insert Stream Operator Property Window </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Insert Stream operator converts a relation  into a stream. The Delete Stream operator converts the deleted records of a changed relation into a stream. The operator takes all records in the current table but not in the immediate table and places them into a stream with a timestamp.</p>
<p> When the insert stream operation is triggered, all of the changed or new records are issued. 
  
 
  In other words, the Insert Stream operator  passes  new records, unlike the Relation Output operator, which issues individual records tagged with either a plus, meaning a new record, or minus, meaning a record was issued previously, but is no longer part of the relation result. </p>
<p>If you want to output data from the IEP process using the Insert Stream operator, connect it to a Stream Output operator.</p>
<p><strong>To create an Insert Stream operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag an Insert Stream operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>
  <li>Connect it to an operator with a relation output. </li>
  <li>Click the Insert Stream operator icon.The Property Editor opens. </li>
  <li>The Details section of the property editor displays the name of the operator and the output schema.</li>
</ol>
