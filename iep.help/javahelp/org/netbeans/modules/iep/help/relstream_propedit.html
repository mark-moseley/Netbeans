The Relation Stream operator provides monitoring of event deletion from or insertion to a relation. </p><p>The relation stream provided is similar to the output of Table Output, showing records that are valid as a result of a prior operation. Each time the IEP event stream is updated, records are added, deleted or not affected. You can use the Relation Stream operator to provide the final result of the operations.</p><p>When a triggering event occurs, the IEP sends out all the records in the relation. Consequently, if you connect this operator to a Stream Output operator, the IEP process will send out all  relation results each time a triggering event occurs. </p><p>When you combine a Relation Stream connected to a Stream Output, you obtain relation results; this differs from using a Relation Output Operator, which sends out only changes to the event stream, rather than the results. </p><p><strong>To create a Relation Stream operator:</strong></p><ol>  <li>Drag a Relation Stream operator from the Palette to the Design view.</li>  <li>Click the Relation Stream operator icon to examine the Details and Attribute sections, if needed.</li></ol><dl><dt><a name="seealso">See Also</a></dt><dd><a href="streamdel_propedit.html">Using the Delete Stream Property Editor</a></dd><dd><a href="streaminsrt_propedit.html">Using the Insert Stream Property Editor </a></dd><dd>&nbsp;</dd><dd><a href="table_propedit.html">Using the Table Property Editor</a></dd><dd>&nbsp;</dd></dl><hr><small><a href="credits.html">Legal Notices</a></small><table cellpadding="150" border="0"> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr> </table> </body></html>
