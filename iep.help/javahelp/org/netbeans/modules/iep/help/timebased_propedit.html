<h2>Using the Time Based Aggregator Operator Property Editor </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Time Based Aggregator operator performs statistical analysis within a specified amount of time which you provide as a Size, which is period of time over which you can perform a calculation,or the time slot. Increment specifies the frequency of the calculation; that is, how often you calculate the statistical analysis..</p>
<p>For example, if you want to calculate a stock price's 20 day moving average, the Size is 20, and the Iincrement is how often you want to perform that calculation, for example, once a day. </p>
<p>Statistics you can compute via SQL statements within the Property Editor of the Tuple Based Aggregator include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sum</li>
  <li>Average</li>
  <li>Minimum</li>
  <li>Maximum</li>
  <li>COUNT</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create a Time Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Drag a Time Based Aggregation operator to the Design area.</li>
  <li>Click the Time Based Aggregation operator  icon.The Property Window opens. </li>
  <li>In the Start field, enter the time to start calculating the tasks that are to be performed by the Time Based Aggregator within the process.</li>
  <li>In the Increment field, enter the  time increment for the time based aggregator to perform the analysis.</li>
  <li>In the Size field, enter the time range  within for the time based aggregator to perform the analysis.</li></ol>
    <p><strong>To define the SQL statements to use with  a Time Based Aggregator operator:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the Expression box, enter the expression for the SQL Select statement which is used to specify the input attribute upon which the Select is performed. Add attribute names, data types. and sizes, as applicable. </li>
      <li>In the From box, define the  input on which to perform the selection. <span class="bold"></span></li>
      <li>In the Where clause box, provide additional filtering on records, for example, <tt>WHERE price &gt; 30.00 AND stockDate &lt; '2006-01-01' </tt>; </li>
      <li>In the Group by box, group a result into subsets that have matching values for one or more columns of the database by specifying a comma separated list of qualified attribute names.</li>
    </ol>
