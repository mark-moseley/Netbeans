# XXX The above lines starting with '../' are a bit suspicious,
# shouldn't they rather point to the target directory then to the source one?

# Regarding the webui local reference above:
# I can't point to ${ravelibs/webui.dir}/${nb.modules.dir}/ext/webui.jar
# because jsfsupport doesn't depend on ravelibs/webui (in ravebuild/build.xml)
# and I can't add that dependency because we get a circular dependency:
#   all-jsfsupport <- all-jsfcl <- all-ravelibs/webui <- all-jsfsupport
# Hopefully jsfcl can be pulled out of the equation soon now that propertyeditors
# etc. are moving over and then this can be cleaned up.
