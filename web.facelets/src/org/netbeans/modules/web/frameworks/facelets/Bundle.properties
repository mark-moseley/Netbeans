Facelets_Name=Facelets
Facelets_Description=The web community is eagerly seeking a framework like Tapestry,\
 backed by JavaServer Faces as the industry standard. While JavaServer Faces and JSP \
are meant to be aligned,Facelets steps outside of the JSP spec and provides a highly \
performant, JSF-centric view technology. Anyone who has created a JSP page will be \
able to do the same with Facelets. The difference is under the hood where all the \
burden of the JSP Vendor API is removed to more greatly enhance JSF performance and \
provide easy plug-and-go development. Even though Facelets is being developed open \
source under Sun's guidance, it can work with any JSF 1.2 compliant implementation or MyFaces.
