  Provides a set of classes to manipulate nodes in JTree components. 
<p>Nodes should help to easier testing of nodes in JTree components. The
most frequent usage in IDE is in the Explorer Window but nodes can be used
in any component which includes a JTree instance. Nodes are also used as
parameters for action's performing. <br>
In this package are predefined specialized nodes for common objects in IDE.
You can use them with combination of generic node instances as you like.
Simple example looks like this: </p>
<p><i><tt>&nbsp; // gets tree from Filesystems tab of the Explorer Window</tt></i> 
<br>
<tt>&nbsp; JTreeOperator treeOperator = RepositoryTabOperator.invoke().tree();</tt> 
<br>
<i><tt>&nbsp; // finds folder "jellytools" under filesystem "jellytools/src"</tt></i> 
<br>
<tt>&nbsp; FolderNode folderNode = new FolderNode(treeOperator, "jellytools/src|org|netbeans|jellytools");</tt> 
<br>
<i><tt>&nbsp; // selects the node</tt></i> <br>
<tt>&nbsp; folderNode.select();</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>&nbsp; // finds child node under jellytools folder</tt></i> <br>
<tt>&nbsp; Node node = new Node(folderNode, "nodes|FolderNode");</tt> <br>
<i><tt>&nbsp; // selects the node</tt></i> <br>
<tt>&nbsp; node.select();</tt> </p>
<p>Items in a node path are separated by "|" character and searching (exact 
match, case sensitivity) is driven by current string comparator. Root node 
must not be included in search path. To get root node instance you need to
supply empty search path or use a getter method: </p>
<p><tt>&nbsp; Node rootNode = new Node(treeOperator, "");</tt> <br>
<tt>&nbsp; // or</tt> <br>
<tt>&nbsp; Node rootNode = RepositoryTabOperator.invoke().getRootNode()</tt><tt>;</tt> 
</p>
