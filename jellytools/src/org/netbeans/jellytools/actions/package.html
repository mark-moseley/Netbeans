 Provides a set of classes to perform popup, main menu, IDE API and shortcut
 actions.
<p>The recommended way how to invoke popup or main menu is through an <tt>{@link
org.netbeans.jellytools.actions.Action}</tt> or <tt>{@link org.netbeans.jellytools.actions.ActionNoBlock}</tt>
instance. Predefined actions in this package are descendants either of <tt>Action</tt>
for non blocking operations or of <tt>ActionNoBlock</tt> for operations which
may block further execution by a modal dialog showing.  <br>
 An action can be performed in "main menu", "popup", "shortcut" or "API"
modes. By default it is performed in the first available mode because not
every action is defined for all four modes. An example of usage can be: </p>
 
<p><tt>&nbsp; <i>// performs in default mode</i></tt> <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new CopyAction().perform();</tt> <br>
 <i><tt>&nbsp; // performs in "menu" mode</tt></i>  <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new CopyAction().performMenu();</tt> </p>
 
<p>It also possible to specify a node or component on which an action will
 be performed: </p>
 
<p><i><tt>&nbsp; // selects node first and then performs on it</tt></i> <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new FindAction().perform(myNode);</tt> <br>
 <i><tt>&nbsp; // focuses component first and then performs action in "popup" 
mode</tt></i> <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new FindAction().performPopup(myComponentOperator);</tt> </p>
 
<p>If an action is not predefined, you can create and use your own action.
  </p>
 
<p><i><tt>&nbsp; // invokes main menu item "Edit|Copy"</tt></i> <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new Action("Edit|Copy", null).perform();</tt> <br>
 <i><tt>&nbsp; // invokes popup menu item "Copy" on given node</tt></i> <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new Action(null, "Copy").perform(myNode);</tt> </p>
 
<p><i><tt>&nbsp; // invokes main menu item "Edit|Find" (first selects given
 node)</tt></i> <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new ActionNoBlock("Edit|Find", null).perform(myFolderNode);</tt>
  <br>
 <i><tt>&nbsp; // invoke popup menu item "Find" on given component</tt></i>
 <br>
 <tt>&nbsp; new ActionNoBlock(null, "Find").perform(myEditorOperator);</tt><br>
</p>
