 Provides a set of classes for setting properties. 
<p>  In the IDE properties settings happens through so called property sheets.
 Property sheet can be docked to any other window. Property sheet consists
 of toolbar ({@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.PropertySheetToolbarOperator
PropertySheetToolbarOperator}) and tabbed pane ({@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.PropertySheetOperator
PropertySheetOperator}). Each tab in pane ({@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.PropertySheetTabOperator
PropertySheetTabOperator}) shows pairs of property name and property value.
Property names are collected in left panel and property values are colected
in right panel.To edit a property, user have to click on property name in
the left panel. Then property value become editable - text field or combo
box appears. That means properties in IDE can be classified into two categories:
 </p>
<ul>
   <li> text field property - JTextField used to enter a new value</li>
   <li> combo box property - JComboBox used to enter a new value</li>
 
</ul>
  Both these types become editable by mouse click or enter keystroke. Also
 both these types can have associated custom editor which can be invoked
by "..." button press.<br>
 You can extend {@link TextFieldProperty} or {@link ComboBoxProperty}, if 
you want to create your specific property. Some common properties are already 
created in this package (ColorProperty, PointProperty, ...).<br>
 Properties can be used the following way:<br>
 
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PropertySheetOperator pso = new PropertySheetOperator("Properties of MyClass");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PropertySheetTabOperator psto = new PropertySheetTabOperator(pso, "Properties");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TextFieldProperty pr = new TextFieldProperty(psto, "Name");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pr.setValue("NewValue");</pre>
 Common custom editors are grouped in package {@link org.netbeans.jellytools.properties.editors 
editors}.<br>
