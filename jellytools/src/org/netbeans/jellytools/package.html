 <p>
Generic jellytools operators which can be used when a specialized operator
is not available are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>NbDialogOperator</li>
  <li> NbFrameOperator (handles both JFrame and JInternalFrame)</li>
  <li> TopComponentOperator</li>
  <li> WizardOperator</li>
</ul>
 NbFrameOperator is recommended ancestor for all frames within IDE. It hides 
differences between SDI and MDI mode and test can work in both modes. NbDialogOperator 
is generic ancestor for majority of IDE dialogs. NbDialogOperator is extended 
by WizardOperator which helps to implement operators for wizards. TopComponentOperator 
represents any dockable view which can reside inside a host frame.
