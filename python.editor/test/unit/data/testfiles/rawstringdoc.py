r"""OS routines for Java, with some attempts to support NT, and Posix
functionality.

This exports:
  - all functions from posix, nt, dos, os2, mac, or ce, e.g. unlink, stat, etc.
  - os.path is one of the modules posixpath, ntpath, macpath, or dospath
  - os.name is 'posix', 'nt', 'dos', 'os2', 'mac', 'ce' or 'riscos'
  - os.curdir is a string representing the current directory ('.' or ':')
  - os.pardir is a string representing the parent directory ('..' or '::')
  - os.sep is the (or a most common) pathname separator ('/' or ':' or '\\')
  - os.altsep is the alternate pathname separator (None or '/')
  - os.pathsep is the component separator used in $PATH etc
  - os.linesep is the line separator in text files ('\r' or '\n' or '\r\n')
  - os.defpath is the default search path for executables

Programs that import and use 'os' stand a better chance of being
portable between different platforms.  Of course, they must then
only use functions that are defined by all platforms (e.g., unlink
and opendir), and leave all pathname manipulation to os.path
(e.g., split and join).
