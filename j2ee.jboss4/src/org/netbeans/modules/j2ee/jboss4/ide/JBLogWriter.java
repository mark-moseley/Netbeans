    /**
     * According to the issue #81951, the BefferedReader.read() method must be used 
     * instead of the BefferedReader.readLine() method, otherwise it hangs on Windows 
     * in the underlying native method call after the server process has been stopped. 
     * On Linux the BefferedReader.readLine() method correctly returns.
     *
     * Parsing is done manually to simulate behavior of the BefferedReader.readLine() method. 
     * According to this, a line is considered to be terminated by any one
     * of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), or a carriage return
     * followed immediately by a line feed.
     *
     * The method is processing each line read using the given LineProcessor. The remaining text
     * (following the last line) is remembered for the next reading in the instance variable.
     *
     * The method is not able to discover whether there will be some additional reading or not, thus
     * theoretically there are several events when the remaining text might not be processed.
     * The first kind of event is when the server process has been started or some other event has occured
     * (e.g. deploying) which causes the server process to log but not to stop.
     * It is not possible to discover that no other input will be read and if the last logged line 
     * is not ended by the 'new-line' character(s) then the remaing text is printed out not until
     * the next input is read.
     * The second kind of event is when the server process has been stopped. The log writer thread 
     * is finished in this case and has opportunity to write out the remaing text.
     * Actually it seems that the JBoss server is logging the whole lines only so the reading is working well
     * in all cases.
