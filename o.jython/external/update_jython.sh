# jython-parser.jar is updated from the jython sources. In theory, you could
# just use the standard Jython trunk or particular build - run the developer-build
# target and then copy out the resulting jython-dev
# jar. However, Jython currently only supports 2.5 - and chokes on 2.6 constructs.
# To avoid NetBeans not being able to even index a 2.6 installation, Frank has
# provided a port which contains a 2.6 grammar. We're using that one for IDE
# parsing - and a more standard 2.5 build for execution.
#
# Run this script to update the jython.jar when applicable.
