/**
 * Interface providing necessary context information for LayoutSupportDelegate
 * implementation. Its purpose is to "connect" the layout delegate with the
 * rest of the layout support infrastructure (which implements this interface).
 * LayoutSupportDelegate receives an instance of LayoutSupportContext as
 * a parameter of initialize method.
 * Besides providing information, this interface also contains two methods
 * which should be called from the layout delegate to notify the infrastructure
 * about changes: containerLayoutChanged and componentLayoutChanged.
 * Note: these calls need not be handled explicitly if the layout support
 * implementation uses FormProperty subclass for properties (instead of
 * Node.Property only).
