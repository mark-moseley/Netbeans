<HTML><BODY>
Using this template you can design a new JFC (Swing) internal frame that can be placed onto a <code>JDesktopPane</code> to provide a MDI user interface.

<p>Typically you would create an internal frame class (or several)
containing display elements for each individual frame; treat it just
like <code>JFrame</code>. Then create an application <code>JFrame</code>
(or <code>JApplet</code>) with a <code>JDesktopPane</code> on it.
The internal frames should be added to the desktop pane using code, not
visually in the Form Editor.
