<HTML><BODY>
Using this template, you can design a new JFC (Swing) internal frame that can be placed 
onto a JDesktopPane to provide an MDI user interface.

<p>Typically you would create an internal frame class containing display elements 
for each individual frame.  Treat each internal frame class like a JFrame
class.

<p>
Then create a JFrame (or JApplet) application with a JDesktopPane on it.  Add the 
internal frames to the desktop pane using code, or using the Copy and Paste functions 
in the Explorer after the internal frames are compiled.
