 <answer id="arch-overall">
  <p>
   Navigator API is good for clients (module writers) that want to show some
   structure or outline of their document in dedicated window, allowing end user
   fast navigation and control over the document.</p>
   <p>
   API allows its clients to plug in their Swing based views easily, which 
   then will be automatically shown in specialized Navigator UI.</p>
   <p>
   Client's views are registered through declarative xml layers approach.</p>

   Unit tests will be written ensuring that implementation loads, instantiates
   and calls client's SPI correctly. Usual manual testing will be performed as
   well. As whole API is rather small, it will be easily covered by unit tests
   as a whole.

   <usecase id="basicUsage" name="Basic Usage Steps" >
      In order to plug in a view into Navigator UI for certain document (data) type,
      module writers need to complete following steps:

      <ul>
        <li><b>Write <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html">NavigatorPanel</a>
         implementation</b></li>
        <li><b>Register implementation class in xml layer</b></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Writing NavigatorPanel implementation</h4>
        <p>Implementing <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorPanel.html">NavigatorPanel</a>
         interface is easy, you can copy from template basic implementation 
        <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/doc-files/BasicNavPanelImpl.java">BasicNavPanelImpl.java</a>.</p>
        
        Advices on important part of panel implementation:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Instantiation:</b> Your implementation of NavigatorPanel
            is instantied automatically by the system if you register it in a layer
            (described in next step). See detailed 
            <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/doc-files/api.html#instances">Instantiation rules</a>
            to understand which kind of instantiation possibilities are on the plate.<p></p></li>

            <li><b>getComponent</b> method: Simply create and return your UI
            representation of your data in Swing's JComponent envelope. Just be sure
            that you don't create new JComponent subclass per every call, as
            performance will suffer then.<p></p></li>

            <li><b>panelActivated and panelDeactivated</b> methods wraps an 
            'active' life of your panel implementation. In panelActivated, grab
            your data from given <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/Lookup.html">Lookup</a>,
            usually by lookuping its asociated
            <a href="@org-openide-loaders@/org/openide/loaders/DataObject.html">DataObject</a>
            or 
            <a href="@org-openide-filesystems@/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html">FileObject</a>
            to take data from. Also remember to attach listeners to lookup result,
            perhaps also to data itself and trigger UI update with new data.
            Code will typically look like this:<br></br>
            <pre>
        /** JavaDataObject used as example, replace with your own data source */
        private static final Lookup.Template MY_DATA = new Lookup.Template(JavaDataObject.class);

        public void panelActivated (Lookup context) {
            // lookup context and listen to result to get notified about context changes
            curResult = context.lookup(MY_DATA);
            curResult.addLookupListener(/** your LookupListener impl here*/);
            Collection data = curResult.allInstances();
            // ... compute view from data and trigger repaint
        }
            </pre>
            Do *not* perform any long computation in panelActivated directly, see below.<br></br>
            In panelDeactivated, be sure to remove all listeners to context given
            to you in panelActivated.<p></p></li>

            <li><b>Long computation of content:</b> What if rendering your
            Navigator view takes long time, more than several milliseconds?
            Right approach is to create and run new task using
            <a href="@org-openide-util@/org/openide/util/RequestProcessor.html">RequestProcessor techniques</a>, 
            each time when panelActivated call arrived or your listeners on 
            data context got called.<br></br>
            While computing, UI of Navigator view
            should show some please wait message.<p></p></li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Registering NavigatorPanel impl in a layer</h4>
       <p>Declarative registration of your NavigatorPanel impl connects this
        implementation with specific content type, which is type of 
        the document, expressed in mime-type syntax, for example 'text/x-java'
        for java sources. Infrastructure will automatically load and show
        your NavigatorPanel impl in UI, when <b>currently activated Node
        is backed by primary FileObject whose 
        <a href="@org-openide-filesystems@/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html#getMIMEType()">FileObject.getMimeType()</a>
        equals to content type specified in your layer.</b></p>
        <p>  
        Writing layer registration itself is easy, you can again copy from template layer
         <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/doc-files/basicNavLayer.xml">
        Basic Navigator Registration Layer</a>.</p>

        Additional important info:

        <ul>
            <li>System looks up for navigator providers only in
            <b>Navigator/Panels</b> folder, nowhere else.<p></p></li>

            <li>Content type is specified as cascade of subdirectories under
                Navigator/Panels directory. Mime-type syntax is recommended and
                handy for specifying content type.<br></br>
                It is not compulsory though, so if you need to make up a name
                for your content type, just go for it. (more below)<p></p></li>
 
        </ul>
        
   </usecase> 

   <usecase id="lookupHint" name="Advanced Content Registration - Linking to Node's Lookup" >
        <p>There may be situations where linking between your Navigator view and
        activated Node's primary FileObject is not enough or not possible at all.
        This simply happens when the data you want to represent in Navigator are
        not accessible through primary FileObject or DataObject. Usual example is
        Multiview environment, where more views of one document exists.</p>
         
        <p>The solution is to bind content of your Navigator view directly to your
        TopComponent. Then, whenever your TopComponent gets activated in the system, Navigator UI
        will show th content you connected to it.</p>
        
        <b>Steps to do:</b>
         
        <ul>
            <li>Choose your content type, could be either well known or arbitrary,
            say <b>'text/my-amazing-type'</b> and
            do all basic steps described in above use case.<p></p></li>
            
            <li>Implement <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/navigator/NavigatorLookupHint.html">NavigatorLookupHint</a>
             interface like this:
             <pre>
        class AmazingTypeLookupHint implements NavigatorLookupHint {
            public String getContentType () {
                return "text/my-amazing-type";
            }
        }
             </pre>
             <p></p></li>
             
            <li>Alter your <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html">TopComponent</a>
             to contain your NavigatorLookupHint implementation (AmazingTypeLookupHint in this case)
            in its lookup, returned from 
            <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getLookup()">TopComponent.getLookup()</a>
             method.<p></p></li>
             
             <li>
             Another option you have is to alter lookup of your <code>Node</code> subclass 
             instead of directly altering lookup of your <code>TopComponent</code>.
             See <a href="@org-openide-nodes@/org/openide/nodes/Node.html#getLookup()">Node.getLookup()</a> method.
             Then Navigator will show your desired content whenever your <code>Node</code>
             subclass will be active in the system.<br></br>             
             However, keep in mind that this option is less preferred, because it
             only uses implementation detail knowledge that default implementation
             of <code>TopComponent.getLookup()</code> includes also results from 
             lookup of asociated <code>Node</code>. So this approach will stop
             working if you change default behaviour of <code>TopComponent.getLookup()</code> method.
             <p></p>

        Navigator listen to system activated node changes and sets activated

        set from system activated node if any provider agrees to display content
        for data object behind the node. Navigator relies on default lookup
        mechanism of TopComponent to populate its activated node.
        Currently it means that if node backed by JavaDataObject is activated node
