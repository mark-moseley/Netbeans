        <question id="arch-what">
            What is this project good for?
            <hint>
            Please provide here few lines describing the the project,
            what problem it should solve, provide links to documentation, 
            specifications, etc.

<answer id="arch-what">
The Modules API lies at the core of NetBeans and describes how plug-in
modules are added and managed.
<api name="ModulesAPI" group="java" type="export" category="official" url="@TOP@/org/openide/modules/doc-files/api.html"/>
</answer>

<answer id="arch-usecases">
	<usecase id="classpath" name="How a classpath of my module is constructed?" >
    The NetBeans is defacto a container that manages individual module's 
    lifecycle and other runtime aspects. One of the important things is 
    that it creates a runtime classpath for provided modules based on
    dependencies they specify in their manifests. The 
    <a href="@TOP@/org/openide/modules/doc-files/classpath.html">
    overview of the runtime infrastructure</a> is a good starting place for
    everyone who wishes to learn more about the NetBeans runtime container
    behaviour.

<!--
        <question id="compat-i18n">
            Is your module correctly internationalized?
            <hint>
            Correct internationalization means that it obeys instuctions 
            at <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/i18n/index.html">
            NetBeans I18N pages</a>.

<answer id="compat-i18n">
Yes

<!--
        <question id="compat-standards">
            Does the module implements or defines any standards? Is the 
            implementation exact or it deviates somehow?
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-standards">
It defines and implements the Modules API. No intentional deviations.
</answer>



<!--
        <question id="compat-version">
            Does your module properly coexists with earlier and future
            versions? Can you correctly read settings? Will future
            versions be able to read settings?
            
            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
Backward compatibility of setting storage for the list of configured modules
is considered a design priority. The implementation of the Modules API uses
an XML format to store this list; it has an associated versioned DTD, and the
1.0 format additionally supports expansion through arbitrary named parameters.
Also, the modules themselves can be considered settings in that a user directory
may contain them, so backward compatibility of the directory layout is maintained.

        <question id="dep-jre">
            Which version of JRE you need (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc.)?
            <hint>
            It is expected that if your module runs on 1.x that it will run 
            on 1.x+1 if no, state that please. Also describe here cases where
            you run different code on different versions of JRE and why.

            What other non-NetBeans projects this one depends on?

            Some non-NetBeans projects are packaged as NetBeans modules
            (see <a href="http://libs.netbeans.org">libraries</a>) and
            it is prefered to use this approach when more modules may

            If it uses more than one JAR, describe where there are located, how
            they refer to each other.

            public?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans module system allows restriction of access rights to
            public classes of your module from other modules. This prevents
            unwanted dependencies of others on your code and should be used

            Often <code>JComponent.getClientProperty</code>, <code>Action.getValue</code>
            or <code>PropertyDescriptor.getValue</code>, etc. are used to influence
            a behaviour of some code. This of course forms an interface that should
            be documented. Also if one depends on some interface that an object
            implements (<code>component instanceof Runnable</code>) that forms an
            API as well.

Not a lot. On modules which are well-formed (layers, JAR entries,
complex interdependencies) but which do not run any code there is a modest
incremental cost: 3.1msec and 4.5Kb per module at least measurement.

No.

            Does your module executes some long running task?
            <hint>Typically they are tasks like connecting over
            network, computing huge amount of data, compilation.
            Such communication should be done asynchronously (for example
            using <code>RequestProcessor</code>), definitively it should 
            not block AWT thread.

Bulk module installation can be time-consuming. <code>org.netbeans.core.ui.ModuleBean</code>
is a Swing-safe bean that serves as a nonblocking wrapper for all module system
modifications and is used e.g. in the <b>Modules</b> node.

        <question id="perf-scale">
            Which external criteria influence the performance of your
            program (size of file in editor, number of files in menu,

            Please include some estimates.

<answer id="perf-scale">
Scalability of the standalone system seems reasonably good; even with
a thousand modules (an order of magnitude higher than current reality)
startup time and memory consumption in the module system itself are
not large (7 seconds, 6 Mb).

Yes, of course - it finds and loads all modules.

            Does your module use <code>java.io.File</code> directly?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans provide a logical wrapper over plain files called 
            <code>org.openide.filesystems.FileObject</code> that
            provides uniform access to such resources and is the prefered
            way that should be used. But of course there can be situations when
            this is not suitable.

            Yes, module JARs and associated resource JARs must be real files.
            They are loaded as defined by module enablement XML files.
        </p>
        <p>
            Module enablement XML files are loaded via Filesystems. The public
            API (partially) specifies them only in these terms.
            <code>autoupdate</code> uses Filesystems to manipulate them when
            necessary, though it relies on some additional
            implementation-specific knowledge of their format (which is fairly
            stable, especially since changes are limited by compatibility
            constraints on old user directories). The NetBeans build scripts use
            some additional implementation knowledge to pregenerate suitable XML
            files for modules included in the application distribution.

        <question id="resources-layer">
            Does your module provide own layer? Does it create some files or
            folders on it? What it is trying to communicate by that and with which 
            component?
            
            <hint>
            NetBeans allows automatic and declarative installation of resources 
            by module layers. Module register files into appropriate places
            and other components use that information to perform their task
            (build menu, toolbar, window layout, list of templates, set of
            options, etc.).

The Modules API defines some layer folders:

<li><samp>ModuleAutoDeps/*.xml</samp> (only read from)</li>

        <question id="resources-mask">
            Does your module mask/hide/override any resource provided by another one in
            module layer? 
            
            <hint>
            If you mask a file provided by another module, you probably depend
            on that and do not want the other module to (for example) change
            the file's name. That module shall thus make that file available as an API
            of some stability category.

            As this is some kind of intermodule dependency, it is a kind of API.

<answer id="resources-read">
XML files are read from the two folders defined by the API.
Note however that since these folders control the module system itself,
contents generally should not be placed in module layers, but in the
<samp>system/</samp> subfolder of the installation or user directory
(generally, in the NBM).
