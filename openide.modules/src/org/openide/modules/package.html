NetBeans is capable of being extended by pluggable
modules
providing additional functionality.

These modules are stored as JAR files containing the extension's
classes, whose manifest file specifies how the module should be
installed. The <a href="doc-files/api.html"><b>Modules
API</b></a> describes how this works.
