/**
* Provides hooks for a custom module that may be inserted into NetBeans.
* If needed this class should be extended by the main class of a module.
*
* <p>Simple modules will likely not need a main class--just a few entries in the manifest file.
* Even modules with a main class need not do anything in it that is already covered by manifest entries;
* only additional special functionality need be handled here.
*
* <p>Specify this class in the manifest file with <code>OpenIDE-Module-Install</code>.
*
* <p>Modules wishing to keep state associated with the installation of the module
* may do so by implementing not only this class but also {@link java.io.Externalizable}.
* In this case, they are responsible for reading and writing their own state
* properly (probably using {@link java.io.ObjectOutput#writeObject} and {@link java.io.ObjectInput#readObject}).
* Note that state which is logically connected to the user's configuration of the module on
* a possibly project-specific basis should <em>not</em> be stored this way, but rather
* using a system option. (Even if this information is not to be displayed, it should
* still be stored as hidden properties of the system option, so as to be switched properly
* during project switches.)
 * <strong>Storing externalizable state in a <code>ModuleInstall</code> is deprecated.</strong>
