     * <div class="nonnormative">
     * <p>
     * When using the normal NetBeans installation structure and NBM file format,
     * this path will be relative to the installation directory (or user directory,
     * for a locally installed module). Other possible installation mechanisms, such
     * as JNLP (Java WebStart), might arrange the physical files differently, but
     * generally the path indicated by a module's normal NBM file (beneath <samp>netbeans/</samp>
     * in the NBM) should be interpreted by the locator implementation to point to the actual
     * location of the file, so the module need not be aware of such details. Some
     * locator implementations may perform the search more accurately or quickly
     * when given a code name base for the module that supplies the file.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The file may refer to a directory (no trailing slash!), in which case the locator
     * should attempt to find that directory in the installation. Note that only one
     * file may be located from a given path, so generally this method will not be
     * useful where a directory can contain many items that may be merged between e.g.
     * the installation and user directories. For example, the <samp>docs</samp> folder
     * (used e.g. for Javadoc) might contain several ZIP files in both the installation and
     * user areas. There is currently no supported way to enumerate all such files. Therefore
     * searching for a directory should be attempted only when there is just one module which
     * is expected to provide that directory and all of its contents. The module may assume
     * that all contained files are in the same relative structure in the directory as in
     * the normal NBM-based installation; unusual locator implementations may need to create
     * temporary directories with matching structures to return from this method, in case the
     * physical file locations are not in such a directory structure.
     * See issue #36701 for details.
     * </p>
     * </div>
     * <p>
     * Localized and branded lookups should follow the normal naming conventions,
     * e.g. <samp>docs/OpenAPIs_ja.zip</samp> would be used for Japanese Javadoc
     * and <samp>locate("docs/OpenAPIs.zip",&nbsp;&#8230;,&nbsp;true)</samp>
     * would find it when running in Japanese locale.
     * </p>
     * <div class="nonnormative">
     * <p>
     * For cases where the search is for a module JAR or one of its extensions, client
     * code may prefer to use the code source given by a class loader. This will permit
     * a client to find the base URL (may or may not refer to a file) responsible for loading
     * the contents of the protection domain, typically a JAR file, containing a class
     * which is accessible to the module class loader. For example:
     * </p>
     * <pre>
     <span class="type">Class</span> <span class="variable-name">c</span> = ClassMyModuleDefines.<span class="keyword">class</span>;
     <span class="type">URL</span> <span class="variable-name">u</span> = c.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation();
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * When running from a JAR file, this will typically give e.g.
     * <samp>file:/path/to/archive.jar</samp>. This information may be useful,
     * but it is not conclusive, since there is no guarantee what the URL protocol
     * will be, nor that the returned URL uniquely identifies a JAR shipped with
     * the module in its canonical NBM format. <code>InstalledFileLocator</code>
     * provides stronger guarantees than this technique, since you can explicitly
     * name a JAR file to be located on disk.
     * </p>
     * </div>
     * <div class="nonnormative">
     * <p>
     * This class should <em>not</em> be used just to find resources on the system
     * filesystem, which in the normal NetBeans installation structure means the
     * result of merging <samp>${netbeans.home}/system/</samp> with <samp>${netbeans.user}/system/</samp>
     * as well as module layers and perhaps project-specific storage. To find data in
     * the system filesystem, use the Filesystems API, e.g. in your layer you can predefine:
     * </p>
     <pre>
     &lt;<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;

     &lt;/<span class="function-name">filesystem</span>&gt;
