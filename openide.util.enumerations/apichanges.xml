     <description>
        enum is a keyword in JDK 1.5 and as such it should not be used. 
        That is the reason why we had to deprecated our 
        <code>org.openide.util.enum</code> package. We are providing 
        replacements of the original classes in form of factory methods

        <code>FilterEnumeration</code> is no longer abstract. The default
        implementation accepts all <code>non-null</code> values.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
<p>The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>release41</code> branch was made on Apr 03 '05 for use in the NetBeans 4.1 release.
Specification versions: 6.0 begins after this point.</li>
<li>The <code>release40</code> branch was made on Nov 01 '04 for use in the NetBeans 4.0 release.
Specification versions: 5.0 begins after this point.</li>
