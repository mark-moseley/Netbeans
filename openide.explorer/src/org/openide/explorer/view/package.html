The Explorer is really an abstraction that needs a

<a href="@TOP@org/openide/explorer/doc-files/api.html"><em>view</em></a>

to actually display the nodes.

The same nodes might be represented as an expandable tree, as a tabbed
pane showing icons, as a popup menu, etc. The

<a href="../doc-files/api.html"><b>Explorer API</b></a>

permits creation of new views, and contains several standard views
that may be reused in special contexts.
