/** Enhances standard property editor to support in-place custom editors and tagged values.
 * <strong>Use of this class is strongly discouraged</strong> - the original
 * NetBeans property sheet did not specify a strong contract for when the
 * property should be updated from an editor such as the custom inplace editor
 * this interface allows you to provide.  The new (NetBeans 4.0 and later)
 * property sheet does specify such a contract, and the InplaceEditor
 * interface exists to allow it to be fulfilled.
 * @author Jan Jancura, Ian Formanek
 * @deprecated Instead of this class, implement ExPropertyEditor and InplaceEditor.Factory.  Also
 * create an implementation of InplaceEditor for the custom inline editor.
 * In the <code>attachEnv()</code> method of your ExPropertyEditor, call
 * <code>PropertyEnv.registerInplaceEditorFactory(this)</code>.  <p><strong>
 * Before you do any of this</strong> read the prose documentation on the
 * Explorer API and be sure you cannot do what you need with an existing
 * property editor - it is very rare to actually need to provide a custom
 * editor component.
