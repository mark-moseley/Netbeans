                    <code>ProvidedExtensions</code> was added.
                    Registering subclass of <code>ProvidedExtensions</code> 
                    as a substitution of <code>InterceptionListener</code> is the way 
                    how to impose handlers for renaming and moving into mastersfs implementation 
                    which was required by module org.netbeans.modules.subversion.

            <h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
            <p>
                The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
                trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
                present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
                was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
                branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
                some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
                and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
                bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.
