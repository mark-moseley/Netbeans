  <BODY>

Readonly DOM level 1 implementation wraping TAX.
Entry point is a set of {@link Wrapper.wrap} methods.

<h3>Why Wrapper?</H3>
Another alternative i.e. let TAX directly implement DOM
intefaces would polute TAX API and cause schizofreny.

<h3>Status</h3>
Prototype that doe not handle refs, PIs, comments etc. It should
prove concept only.

<h3>Why so Many new</H3>
Claim: Latest HotSpot has very optimalized <code>new</code> and
authors suggest to leave classical pool approach.
<p>Consequence: This implementation uses very lightweight wrappers
therefore only drawback it increased garbage production. It should
be also handled in latest HotSpot implementations.
