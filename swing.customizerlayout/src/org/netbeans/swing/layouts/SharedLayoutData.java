/**
 * An interface implemented by an ancestor component that allows nested panels
 * to all align their columns.  Usage:  Create a panel, set its layout to 
 * LDPLayout, and add some components to be displayed in a horizontal row.
 * Add them to a component that implements, or has an ancestor that implements,
 * SharedLayoutData.  The LDPLayout instance will access the SharedLayoutData
 * ancestor to find the column positions across all children that implement
 * LayoutDataProvider, even if they are not all children of the same component.
 * <p/>
 * To easily create a component that implements SharedLayoutData, just subclass
 * a JPanel or similar, implement SharedLayoutData and delegate to an instance
 * of DefaultSharedLayoutData, which handles memory management appropriately.
 * Borrowed from http://imagine.dev.java.net
