/**
 * A panel which, if it has an ancestor that implements SharedLayoutData, will
 * automatically align its so that all children of that parent have their
 * columns aligned.  Use for a set of components (such as a label for something
 * followed by a control that affects that setting) which will appear in an
 * ancestor component, but may be children of each other, yet should nonetheless
 * have their columns aligned.
 * <p/>
 * Note that the layout manager may not be set at runtime on instances of
 * SharedLayoutPanel.
 * <p/>
 * SharedLayoutPanels also have an &quot;expanded&quot; property - a component
 * may hide some data until a button is clicked, at which point it grows and
 * displays a detail view.  By default any SharedLayoutPanel shares its 
 * expanded setting with all others owned by the same SharedLayoutData ancestor,
 * so if any one is expanded, all others are set to unexpanded - so only one is
 * expanded at a time.
