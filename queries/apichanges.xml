INFO FOR PEOPLE ADDING CHANGES:

Check the DTD (apichanges.dtd) for details on the syntax. You do not
need to regenerate the HTML, as this is part of Javadoc generation; just
change the XML. Rough syntax of a change (several parts optional):

<change>
    <api name="compiler"/>
    <summary>Some brief description here, can use <b>XHTML</b></summary>
    <version major="1" minor="99"/>
    <date day="13" month="6" year="2001"/>
    <author login="jrhacker"/>
    <compatibility addition="yes"/>
    <description>
        The main description of the change here.
        Again can use full <b>XHTML</b> as needed.
    </description>
    <class package="org.openide.compiler" name="DoWhatIWantCompiler"/>
    <issue number="14309"/>
</change>

Also permitted elements: <package>, <branch>. <version> is API spec
version, recommended for all new changes. <compatibility> should say
if things were added/modified/deprecated/etc. and give all information
related to upgrading old code. List affected top-level classes and
link to issue numbers if applicable. See the DTD for more details.

Changes need not be in any particular order, they are sorted in various
ways by the stylesheet anyway.

Dates are assumed to mean "on the trunk". If you *also* make the same
change on a stabilization branch, use the <branch> tag to indicate this
and explain why the change was made on a branch in the <description>.

Please only change this file on the trunk! Rather: you can change it
on branches if you want, but these changes will be ignored; only the
trunk version of this file is important.

Deprecations do not count as incompatible, assuming that code using the
deprecated calls continues to see their documented behavior. But do
specify deprecation="yes" in <compatibility>.

This file is not a replacement for Javadoc: it is intended to list changes,
not describe the complete current behavior, for which ordinary documentation
is the proper place.

            <api name="general"/>
            <summary>Added <code>fileinfo</code> package with <code>NonRecursiveFolder</code> interface.</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="4"/>
            <date day="14" month="1" year="2005"/>

            <description>
                <p>
                    <code>fileinfo</code> package introduced for classes providing extra
                    information about files or folders. <code>NonRecursiveFolder</code> interface
                    added. It marks a representation of a folder that have non-recursive
                    content (does not contain subfiles).
                </p>

            <api name="general"/>

            <compatibility>
                <p>
                    Clients should begin requesting the new version to avoid a warning at startup.

            <description>
                <p>
                    To indicate that this is now considered a stable API, the major release version was
                    incremented to 1 from 0.
