 * available it delegates to it. When the implementation isn't available in the
 * <code>DataObject</code> lookup or it returns null it tries to find a
 * project corresponding to the file and checks whether that project has an
 * implementation of this interface in its lookup. If so, it delegates to
 * that implementation. Therefore it is not generally necessary
 * for a project type provider nor data loader to register its own global implementation of
 * this query.

 * to the correct {@link Charset} when the encoding is found in the buffer or signal 
 * that they are not able to process the file and other {@link Charset} should be used
