<body>

General "queries" or communication channels pertaining to aspects of how files
are used and related.

<p>These queries permit a module to ascertain limited kinds of information about
files or other interesting artifacts, where the information is ultimately
supplied by a possibly unrelated module, without mandating a direct dependency.
The querier is insulated from needing to understand, much less rely on details
of, the model used by the query implementation.</p>

<p>Although the queries are heavily used by project-related code, they may be
both queried and implemented without any projects at all.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.api.queries.CollocationQuery} checks whether files are
logically part of one directory tree and thus whether relative paths between
them would have any sense. {@link org.netbeans.api.queries.FileBuiltQuery} can
be used to see if a file that can be "built", currently needs to be.
{@link org.netbeans.api.queries.SharabilityQuery} checks whether a file is
intended to be important data kept in a version-control system.</p>
