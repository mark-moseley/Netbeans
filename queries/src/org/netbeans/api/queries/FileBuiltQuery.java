     * will not be see the change if a provider is later installed dynamically.
     * Similarly, removal of a provider will not automatically invalidate an
     * existing {@link Status} object; and a change in the provider responsible
     * for a given file will not produce updates in an existing {@link Status}.
     * A future implementation may however be enhanced to return proxy statuses
     * which react to changes in the provider responsible for the file and always
     * delegate to the current provider, if there is one.
