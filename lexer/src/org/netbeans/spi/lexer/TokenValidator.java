 * <br/>
 * Token validator can refuse validation by returning null from its only method
 * if the modification affects the token or if the validation is unsure.

 * Token validation is part of fine-tuning of the lexing

 * such as whitespace or comments.
 * <br/>
 * The advantage of validation is that compared to lexing
 * it typically only explores the modified characters and few adjacent characters.
