/**
 * Lexer reads input characters from {@link LexerInput} and groups
 * them into tokens.
 * <br/>
 * The lexer delegates token creation
 * to {@link TokenFactory#createToken(TokenId)}.
 * Token factory instance should be given to the lexer in its constructor.
 *
 * <p>
 * The lexer must be able to express its internal lexing
 * state at token boundaries and it must be able
 * to restart lexing from such state.
 * <br>
 * It is expected that if the input characters following the restart point
 * would not change then the lexer will return the same tokens
 * regardless whether it was restarted at the restart point
 * or run from the input begining as a batch lexer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Testing of the lexers</b>:
 * <br/>
 * Testing of newly written lexers can be performed in several ways.
 * The most simple way is to test batch lexing first
 * (see e.g.
 * <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/source/browse/lexer/test/unit/src/org/netbeans/lib/lexer/test/simple/Attic/SimpleLexerBatchTest.java">
 * org.netbeans.lib.lexer.test.simple.SimpleLexerBatchTest</a> in lexer module tests).
 * <br/>
 * Then an "incremental" behavior of the new lexer can be tested
 * (see e.g. <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/source/browse/lexer/test/unit/src/org/netbeans/lib/lexer/test/simple/Attic/SimpleLexerIncTest.java">
 * org.netbeans.lib.lexer.test.simple.SimpleLexerIncTest</a>).
 * <br/>
 * Finally the lexer can be tested by random tests that randomly insert and remove
 * characters from the document
 * (see e.g. <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/source/browse/lexer/test/unit/src/org/netbeans/lib/lexer/test/simple/Attic/SimpleLexerRandomTest.java">
 * org.netbeans.lib.lexer.test.simple.SimpleLexerRandomTest</a>).
 * <br/>
 * Once these tests pass the lexer can be considered stable.
