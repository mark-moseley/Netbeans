/**
 * Browsable list of tokens.
 * <br>
 * {@link org.netbeans.api.lexer.TokenSequence} delegates
 * all its operation to this class so any service provider
 * delivering this class will be able to produce token sequences.
 *
 * There are various implementations of the token list:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>BatchTokenList</li> - predecessor of batch token lists
 *   <li>TextTokenList</li> - token list over immutable char sequence
 *   <li>CopyTextTokenList</li> - token list over text input
 *     that needs to be copied. Characters that belong to tokens
 *     skipped due to skipTokenIds do not need to be copied.
 *   <li>SkimTokenList</li> - filter over CopyTextTokenList
 *     to store the token characters in multiple arrays
 *     and to correctly compute the tokens' starting offsets.
 *   <li>IncTokenList</li> - token list for mutable-input environment.
 *   <li>EmbeddedTokenList</li> - token list for a single language embedding
 *     suitable for both batch and incremental environments.
 * </ul>
