     * given to it on input.
     * However it should not preprocess EOF in any way
     * - the EOF is just information that there is an end of the input
     * and any possibly unfinished escape sequence needs to be translated
     * in a reasonable way.
     * <br/>
     * Once all the characters prior EOF were preprocessed the EOF
     * should be returned by {@link #outputOriginal(int)}.
