Recognition of URIs inside regular text.
For example the following URI http://www.google.com should be recognized
as an extra http-uri token while the rest of the line is recognized
as text token. Similarly ftp://ftp.redhat.com
should have ftp-uri while other URIs should
default to generic uri token identification
such as myscheme://my-server.org
