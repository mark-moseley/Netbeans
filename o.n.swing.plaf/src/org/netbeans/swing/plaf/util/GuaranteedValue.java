/** A simple mechanism for guaranteeing the presence of a value in UIDefaults.
 * Some look and feels (GTK/Synth) don't necessarily provide these colors,
 * resulting in null pointer exceptions.  Since we want to make it easy to
 * write maintainable components, it is preferable to centralize guaranteeing
 * the value here, rather than have the codebase littered with null tests and
 * fallbacks for null colors.
 *
 * It will either take on the existing value if present, or used the passed 
 * value if not present.  If passed an array of UIManager keys, it will try
 * them in order, and use the first value that returns non-null from 
 * <code>UIManager.get()</code>.
 *
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 * UIManager.put (new GuaranteedValue("controlShadow", Color.LIGHT_GRAY));
 *   or
 * UIManager.put (new GuaranteedValue(new String[] {"Tree.foreground", 
 *    List.foreground", "textText"}, Color.BLACK));
 * </pre>
 *
 * It can also be used to ensure a value matches another value, with a fallback
 * if it is not present: 
 * <pre>
 * UIManager.put("TextArea.font", new GuaranteedValue ("Label.font", new Font("Dialog", Font.PLAIN, 11)))
