/**
 * Value that can be placed into UIDefaults, which will put additional items into
 * UIDefaults when its value is requested.
 * <p>
 * The idea is to avoid putting a lot of things that may not be used into
 * UIDefaults on startup.  So, for example, the first time a tab control's UI
 * is requested, this value will return the string from which the UI can be
 * fetched - but first it will put the assorted keys and values that that UI
 * will need into UIDefaults.
 * <p>
 * Since multiple UIs may require the same things in UIDefaults, there is the
 * method createShared(), which will create another instance (really an inner
 * class instance) that shares the code and key/value pairs.  Whichever is
 * asked for first will initialize the keys and values required.  So the usage
 * pattern is something like:
 * <pre>
 * Object someKeysAndValues = new Object[] {"fooColor", Color.BLUE, "barColor", Color.RED};
 * UIBootstrapValue bv = new UIBootstrapValue ("com.foo.FnordUIClass", someKeysAndValues);
 * Object next = bv.createShared ("com.foo.ThiptUIClass");
 * UIManager.put ("FnordUI", bv);
 * UIManager.put ("ThiptUI", next);
 * </pre>
