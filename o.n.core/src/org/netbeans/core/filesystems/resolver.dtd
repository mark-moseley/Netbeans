<!--- 
  A file (resource) represents the MIME resolver input.
  The resource is tested on attributes obtained from lower layers (OS) such
  as extension, header bytes and wrapping <tt>FileObject</tt> attributes.
  Arbitrary of them must match to proceed to <tt>resolver</tt> element.
  <p>
  Implementation Note: 
  Lower level MIME type is obtained by FileUtil.getMIMEType(). It can not be 
  retrieved by FileObject.getMIMEType call to avoid recursion. A better way
  how to reach MIME type as assigned by OS may be instroduced in future.
  </p>
  <p>
  Implementation Note: 
  All other test are performed by calling approptiate methods at FileObject
  so there is danger of recursion if these calls <tt>this.getMIMEType()</tt>.

  Tests resource extension for full equality.

<!---
  Tests resource MIME type for equality (RFC2045) or suffix equality if it 
  starts with '+' (RFC 3023).

<!ELEMENT mime EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST mime name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--- 
  Look at first bytes of file and compare them for full match.

  E.g. <tt>$lt;magic hex="0aFF00"/></tt>

  Test on OpenIDE FileObject attributes. Matching attribute it tested on
  its <tt>text</tt> value obtained by <code>toString()</code> call.
  <p>
  FileObject attributes can be used for out-of-band tagging of standard documents.

  It may apply additional rules based on resource content.
  <tt>mime</tt> element value is returned. Use reserved value of <tt>null</tt>
  fast indicating that not interested in such files (== <tt>&lt;exit/></tt>).
