    *   while (offset &lt; offset2) {
    *     if (buffer[offset]-meets-condition) {

    * Caution! Nothing can be written to the data comming in buffer to
    * <CODE>find()</CODE> method because of performance reasons
    * these are primary document data, not a copy.
    * Buffer is always guaranteed to have at least one char - it is
    * char standing at reqPos. However there can be calls to <CODE>find()</CODE>
    * when there will be only that one character, so <CODE>find()</CODE> must
    * must be prepared for this.
    * Unlike calling <CODE>DocCache.find()</CODE> the offset1 &lt; offset2 even
    * for backward searches.
    * @param bufferStartPos begining position of the buffer (not search area).
    * @param buffer buffer with chars to be searched
    * @param offset1 offset of begining of searchable area in buffer.
    *   No searching below this offset can be performed.
    * @param offset2 offset of end of searchable area in buffer.
    *   No searching beyond this offset can be performed.
    * @param reqPos required position. Initially it is the begining
    *   search position requested by caller. In subsequent calls
    *   it is the same value as returned from previous call
    *   to <CODE>find()</CODE> method.
    * @param limitPos is filled with position beyond which search cannot go.
    *   (i.e. forward: pos &lt; limitPos and backward: pos &gt;= limitPos)
    *   Some finders i.e. finder that tries to find some word with
    *   whole-words-only flag turned on can benefit
    *   from this information. If the searched word is at the very end of
    *   the document the finder wouldn't normally find it as it would request
    *   the next buffer even when the whole word was matched because the finder
    *   needs to find white space to know the word ended there. However this
    *   would be beyond the search area so EOT exception would be raised. 
    *   To correctly manage this situation finder must care for limitPos.
    *   When it sees the word and knows this is the last text in document
    *   it signals that it found the word.
    * @return in case the string was found, <CODE>find()</CODE>
    *   method returns the position (not offset) where the string starts
    *   (and must also set some flag resulting to that <CODE>isFound()</CODE>
    *   method will return true).
    *   If the string was not yet found, the function should return
    *   position (not offset) where the next search should continue. If this
    *   position is greater or equal than limit position
    *   (lower than limit position for backward search),
    *   searching will stop resulting in -1 as returned position.
    *   The position returned will be passed as <CODE>reqPos</CODE> in next
    *   call to <CODE>find()</CODE> method.
