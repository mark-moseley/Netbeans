/**
 * Interface marking the flyweight views.
 * <br>
 * Flyweight views
 * are immutable view instances that can be shared in arbitrary number of
 * occurrences.
 * <br>
 * They are typically only leaf views usually built on top of flyweight
 * elements.
 *
 * <p>
 * A view can be rendered differently in various rendering contexts.
 * Rendering contexts can affect measurements done by the view.
 * Therefore there are methods that can replicate the view
 * into a new instance in a particular context.
 *
 * <p>
 * Flyweight views cannot hold a reference to parent
 * and their <code>getParent()</code> returns null.
 * <br>
 * A call to <code>setParent()</code> would throw an exception.
 * <br>
 * Their <code>getElement()</code> returns <code>null</code>.
 * <br>
 * <code>getStartOffset()</code> always returns 0.
 * <br>
 * <code>getEndOffset()</code> returns length of the text
 * that they represent.
 * <br>
 * <code>getContainer()</code> always returns null.
