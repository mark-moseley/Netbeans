/**
 * Maintainer of the children of the {@link GapBoxView}.
 * <br>
 * It also acts as a runnable task for flushing requirement
 * changes of the view it works for.
 *
 * Besides the current implementation there could be
 * an implementation for small number of children (e.g. up to 20)
 * which would not have to use index gap and which would use indexes
 * &lt;= 127 that could be merged into shorts by pairs.
 * This approach could save about 40 bytes.
 * <br>
 * However the GapBoxView is able to unload its children
 * dynamically which can save much more memory
 * than the described simplified implementation.
