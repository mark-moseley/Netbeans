/** JTables do not automatically scale their row height with font size, so when

 *  tables are too narrow and only marginally usable.  For --fontsize 24, the text

 *  scales the row height with the font size or if the font is changed.  It does not 
 *  take icon height into account  but we don't use icons anywhere.
