 *  Enumerated types for various J2EE versions.
 *
 *  Be careful with the compareTo method of this class.  It is there for comparing
 *  like versions (e.g. servlet 2.3 versus 2.4) only, but there is no type safety
 *  to prevent doing dumb things like comparing J2EE 1.4 with servlet 2.3.
 *
 *  Perhaps I can think of a better design in the next version.
