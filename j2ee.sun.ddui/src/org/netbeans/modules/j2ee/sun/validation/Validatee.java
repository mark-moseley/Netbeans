/**
 * Validatee  is an <code>Interface</code> implemented by an <code>Object</code>
 * that needs to be validated.
 * <p>
 * In order to validate an object, framework expects either of the two things;
 * Object being validated is a Validatee itself(it implements Validatee
 * interface) or a separate Validatee Implementation for this Object is provided.
 * <p>
 * If a separate Validatee Implementation is provided then an entry needs to be
 * added to an Implementation File. Framework uses information in Implementation
 * File to figure out which Validatee Implementation to use for a given object.
 * Implementation File is a <code>.properties<code> file with name-value pair
 * enteries in it. Entry in an Implementation File is of the form :
 *    [fully qualified Object Name]=[Validatee Implementation for this Object]
 * Implementation File to be used is specified through system property 
 * <code>impl.file</code>
 * <p>
 * Validation framework has the Validatee Implementation for Schema2beans 
 * objects(<code>BaseBean</code>). You can override any Validatee Implementation
 * that comes with framework, by providing your own.
 * <p>
 * Validations are performed, recursively on the given Object.
 * Two types of Validations are perfomed, Structural validations and Specified
 * validations. Structural validations are expressed through 
 * <code>{@link CardinalConstraint}</code>. <code>CardinalConstraint</code> is 
 * an implicit Constraint. Its always applied to each of the element; you dont
 * need to specify it explicitly. Where as , other Constaints need to be
 * explicitly specified for each element you wanted to apply it to.
 * Constraints to be applied are specified through xml. This xml file is called
 * Validation File.  Validation file is xml file based on  
 * <code>validation.dtd</code>. You can also define, your own custom
 * <code>Constraint</code>s and apply them to any elements.
