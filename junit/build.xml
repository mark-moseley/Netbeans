        Declare that you want to release the binary patch of Ant 1.7.0,
        which allows for execution of a single JUnit test method
        or execution of test methods that failed during the previous run.
        The patch contains classes from package
        org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit,
        of which some are modified and one is added.
        See also http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=72080.
        The source code patch is placed in the .jar archive, in the root
        directory.
