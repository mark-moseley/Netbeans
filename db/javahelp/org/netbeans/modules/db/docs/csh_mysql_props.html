        <h2>MySQL Server Properties Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>This dialog box enables you to set the properties for connecting to your MySQL database server.
        You open this dialog box by right-clicking the MySQL Server
        node in the Services window and choosing Properties.</p>

    <p>The MySQL Server Properties dialog box contains two tabs in which you can set properties for accessing  your MySQL database server. </p>
        <li>The <strong>Basic Properties</strong> tab. You can set the following properties in this tab:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Server host  name.</b> Type the host name for the MySQL server. The default host is <tt>localhost.</tt> </li>
            <li><b>Server port number.</b> Type the port number for the database. The default port number for the MySQL database server is <tt>3306</tt>. </li>
            <li><strong>Administrator user name.</strong> Type the Administrator user name for administrative access to the MySQL Server. You need administrative access to be able to create and remove databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Administrator password.</strong> Type the password for the server administrator. A blank password can also be a valid password. </li>
            <li><b>Save Password</b>. Select this if you want the IDE to remember your password. 
              If selected, you will not be prompted for the user name and password on subsequent connections to the database
            and the Remember Password property is set to True.            </li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Storing a password represents a potential security risk.
            The MySQL password is stored in a properties file in <tt>config/Preferences/org/netbeans/modules/db/mysql.properties</tt>  in the IDE user dir.
            Passwords are scrambled but they are not encrypted.            This provides protection from accidental exposure of the password, but it can be fairly easily unscrambled.  If you are concerned about security, you can make sure the permissions on this file are restricted to approved users and groups</li>
        </ul></li>
<li>The <strong>Admin Properties</strong> tab. You can set the following properties in this tab:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Path/URL to admin tool.</b> Type the full path or web URI to the tool you want to use to administer the MySQL server. </li>
            <li><b>Arguments</b>. Type any  arguments for the admin tool command in this field. </li>
            <li><strong>Path to start command. </strong>Type the location or browse for the MySQL start command. This is often the path to <tt>mysqld</tt> in the <tt>bin</tt> folder of the MySQL installation directory. You may need administrative access to run this program.  If so, you can either run NetBeans as a user with administrative rights, or if you are on Unix you can use <tt>gksu</tt>.  To use <tt>gksu</tt>, make the start command <tt>/usr/bin/gksu</tt> (or wherever gksu is located on your system) and then make the path to mysqld the argument to the command.</li>
            <li><strong>Arguments.</strong> Type any  arguments for the start command in this field. </li>
            <li><strong>Path to stop command.</strong>   Type the location or browse for the MySQL stop command. This is often the  path to <tt>mysqladmin</tt> in the <tt>bin</tt> folder of the MySQL installation directory. As with the start command, you may need administrative access to run this program. See &quot;Path to the start command&quot; for more information. </li>
            <li><strong>Arguments</strong>. Type any  arguments for the start command in this field. If the command is <tt>mysqladmin</tt> then the arguments are normally <tt>-u root stop</tt>.</li>
        </ul>
</li>
</ul>
