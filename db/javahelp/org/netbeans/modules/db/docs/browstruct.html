<h2>Browsing Structures</h2>

<p>Databases consist of the following, each of which represent a list of columns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tables</li>
  <li>Views</li>
  <li>Stored procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>The Database Explorer follows this structure when displaying the database. 
  <br>
  Accordingly, new nodes that appear under a connection when it is live<br>
  represent tables, views, and procedures.</p>
<p><b>To browse a table</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the table node.. </li>
  <li> Expand the table node to see the table's columns and an indexes node, showing 
    all indexes defined on a given table. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Columns</b>
<p>Columns are distinguished by color:
<ul>
  <li>Red represents columns that are a member of the primary key.</li>
  <li>Blue represents an ordinary column.</li>
  <li>Green represents indexed columns that are present in one or more indexes</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Indexes</b></p>
<p>Click on an index node to see a list of the columns indexed for a given table.</p>
<p> <b>Views</b></p>

  <p> Click the Views node to see the Views on a given database.</p>

<p>View columns are shaded gray; you cannot change the physical characteristics 
  <br>
  of columns in a view. However, you can change a view by dropping the view and 
  subsequently <br>
  recreating it.</p>
<p><b>Procedures</b></p>
<p> Choose Procedures to view stored procedure names and their <code>in</code> 
  and <code>out</code> parameters.</p>
