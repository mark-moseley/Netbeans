<h2>Executing SQL Commands Using the Database Explorer</h2>
<p>You can use the Database Explorer to execute a SQL command.
To execute a SQL command: 
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on the one node under the connection node.
  <li>Select Execute command ... from the context menu. A dialog with an empty SQL command
      appears.
  <li>Enter a new (DDL or DML) command.
  <li>Press Execute to run the Query.
  <li>Examine the results in the spreadsheet-like view. Forte for Java keeps
      all commands you enter and presents them in a drop-down box for
      your subsequent use. 
</ol>
