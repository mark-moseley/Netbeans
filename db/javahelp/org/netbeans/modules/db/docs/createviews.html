        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

        <p>The Database Explorer enables you to create SQL views that are part of the
        database itself and are available to application programs and other clients
        of the database. </p>
        <p> <b>To create views:</b> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Runtime window, expand the node for a connected database.</li>
            <li>Right-click Views and choose Add View.</li>
            <li>In the Add View dialog box, type the name of the view in the View Name text field. The IDE stores the name in a database. </li>
            <li>Enter the SQL (<tt>SELECT</tt>) statement into the text area and click OK. 
	    The IDE adds a node for the new view (&nbsp;<img src="images/view.gif" alt="View node">&nbsp;) under the Views node for the database. </li>
        </ol>
	<p>Once the view is saved, you can execute the SQL statement by right-clicking the view in the Runtime window and choosing View Data.</p>
