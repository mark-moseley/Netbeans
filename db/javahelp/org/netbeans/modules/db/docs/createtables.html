<h2> Creating Tables</h2>
<p>Forte for Java enables you to create a database table with columns and to add
  this table to database. You can open the Create table dialog in either:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The pop-up menu for Tables, or</li>
  <li>The pop-up menus for existing tables.</li>
</ol>
<p> You can create a table for one database at time. </p>
<p> <b>To create a table using the Create table dialog:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> Enter the Table name. This name must follow conventions for table names
    your database; case is usually<br>
    insignificant and you must not use spaces. </li>
  <li> Select the Owner of the new table from the possible names of database users
    offered to you in the dialog.<br>
    The dialog defaults to the name by which you are connected. </li>
  <li>Click Add column or Remove to add or remove columns from the table. Each
    displayed row will be a <br>
    column in the new table. </li>
  <li>Once you have specified Name, Type, and Size, the table is created. All
    other properties are optional,<br>
    according to your needs. See the description of Add column for details on
    customizing your table. </li>
  <li>Click OK to create the table. </li>
</ol>
<p> <b>Using a database snapshot to recreate a table and its structure without
  data:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on a table.</li>
  <li>Select Grab structure.</li>
  <li>Forte for Java prompts you for a file name in which to save the structure
    of the table (the table definition.)</li>
  <li>Select Recreate table from the context menu of the Tables node, or</li>
  <li>Select Recreate table from the node of any table under the Tables node.</li>
  <li>Select a file name to load to send the proper SQL commands to the database
    to recreate a table.</li>

</ol>
<p><b>Recreating tables in a different database:</b></p>
<p>You can recreate tables in a different database from the one from which you
  saved the structure, even if the SQL syntax to<br>
  create the second database is different from the syntax of the first. You can
  thus create database-independent schemas<br>
  with the Database Explorer. To do so, you can, for example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Develop a complete application with a Pointbase database. </li>
  <li>For deployment, transfer the table structures to an Oracle database to create
    the Oracle database without editing SQL .</li>
</ol>
