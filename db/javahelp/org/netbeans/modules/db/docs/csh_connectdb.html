        <h2>Connect to Database Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>This dialog box enables you to supply the user name and password to open an
        existing database connection.
        You open this dialog box by doing the following right-clicking the database connection
        node in the Services window and choosing Connect.</p>

        <p>To open an existing database connection, you need to supply the following details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Name.</b> Type user name for the database.</li>
            <li><b>Password.</b> Type the password for the database.</li>
            <li><b>Remember Password</b> Select this if you want the IDE to remember your password. 
            <p>If selected, you will not be prompted for the user name and password on subsequent connections to the database
            and the Remember Password property is set to True.</p> 
            <p>To set the Remember Password property to False, right-click the database connection node
            in the Services window and choose Properties and modify the property in the Properties window.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Storing a password represents a potential security risk.
            Connection passwords are stored in an xml file in the <tt>config/Databases/Connections</tt> directory in the IDE user dir.
            Passwords are scrambled but they are not encrypted.
            <p>For more about securing database passwords, see the following NetBeans FAQ:<p>
