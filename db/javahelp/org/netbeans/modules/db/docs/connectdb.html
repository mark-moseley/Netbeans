<h2>Connecting to a Database </h2>

There are two ways to open the New Connection dialog box, which lets you connect
  Forte for Java to a database. </p>
<ol>
  <li>In the contextual menu for Databases or for any existing connection, select
    Add Connection.</li>
  <li> In the contextual menu for a driver, select Connect Using... to preselect 
the driver.</li>
</ol>
Enter the following information in the Connect Using... dialog box:
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the correct driver is selected in Driver name. </li>
  <li> Provide the JDBC URL for the database connection in the Database URL. </li>
  This URL typically begins with <code>jdbc:</code>, followed by a short code
    name for the driver, followed 
    by another colon.<br>
  The rest of the URL depends on the type of driver you are using. <br>
    For example, you might need to specify a host and port; alternatively, the
    name of a 
    database file might suffice, or an ODBC DSN.<br>
  To help you get started, existing drivers are provided with templates for
    the correct URL format;
    if in doubt, refer to the documentation for the driver you are using.
  <li>Provide the user name and password, if required by your database 
configuration.</li>
  <li>Click the Remember Password checkbox to have the IDE remember your password.
  </li>
<table>
<tr><td valign=top align=left><img src="images/tip.gif"></td>
<td valign=top align=left>The password is saved only for
        the current Forte for Java session;
        after restarting Forte for Java the password must be entered again.
        This feature can be turned on or off in the properties of each connected
        database in the Explorer. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <li>Click OK to connect Forte for Java to the database.</li>
  <li>If the connection is successful, a new node appears on the same level as
    Drivers.<br>
    The icon for a connected database shows complete. </li>
</ol>
If the connection attempt fails, Forte for Java displays a dialog box indicating
  the connection is broken.
<p> <b>To correct the connection:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> Correct the URL in the property sheet.</li>
  <li>Connect to the database from the Popup Menu.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To disconnect from the database connection</b>:</p>
Choose Disconnect from the Connection contextual menu. You cannot browse
  the database until you reconnect to the database using Connect.
