        <h2>Connecting to a Database</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Once the drivers for your database have been added and are visible
        in the Databases node, you can open a connection to the database.</p>     
        <p>Once the initial connection has been made you can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correct a broken connection</li>
            <li>Disconnect and reconnect to a database</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p><b>To open a new connection:</b></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Check to make sure that your database is running.</li>
            <li>In the Runtime window, expand the Databases node and the Drivers node.</li>
            <li>Right-click your driver's instance node and choose Connect Using.</li>
            <li>In the New Database Connection dialog box, ensure the correct driver is 
            selected in the Driver field. </li>
            <li>Provide the JDBC URL for the database connection in the Database URL field. 
                <p> This URL typically begins with <tt>jdbc:</tt>and a short code name 
                for the driver, followed by another colon. The rest of the URL depends on 
                the type of driver you are using. For example, you might need to specify 
                a host and port; alternatively, the name of a database file might suffice, 
                or an ODBC DSN. For MySQL, the Database URL might look as follows:
                <pre>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase</pre>
                To help you get started, existing drivers are provided with 
                templates for the correct URL format. If in doubt, refer to the documentation 
                for the driver you are using. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Provide the user name and password, if required by your database configuration.</li>
            <li>Click the Remember Password checkbox to have the IDE remember your password. 
                <p> The password is saved only for the current IDE session. After restarting 
                the IDE, you must type the password again. This feature can be turned on 
                or off by right-clicking the node for a disconnected database in the Runtime window and
                selecting or deselecting Remember password in the Properties dialog box. </p>
            </li>
            <li>Click OK to connect the IDE to the database.
                <ul class="note"><li>When connecting to the database, the schema with the same name as the user name is 
                    set as default, but if a schema with that name does not exist, 
                    you are automatically switched to the Advanced Tab to select a schema. 
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the connection is successful, the database connection node appears on the same level as 
        Drivers in the Databases node. The database connection node appears whole
        indicating the database is connected. 
        Expand the database connection node to see the child folders 
        representing lists of tables, views and procedures.

        <p>If the connection 
        attempt fails, the IDE displays a dialog box indicating the connection 
        is broken and the database connection node is broken.</p>
            
        <p><b>To correct a broken connection:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the broken database connection node and choose Properties from the 
            contextual menu.</li>
            <li>Enter the correct Database URL in the properties dialog box and click Close.</li>
            <li>Right-click on the broken database connection node and choose
            Connect from the contextual menu.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>To disconnect from the database connection:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click the database connection node and choose Disconnect from the contextual menu. 
                <p> You cannot browse the database until you reconnect to the database. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
