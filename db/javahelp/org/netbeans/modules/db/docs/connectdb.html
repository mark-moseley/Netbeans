<h2>Connecting or Disconnecting from a Database</h2>

<p>You can use the Database Explorer to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Connect to a database</li>

  <li>Display schema information for a database</li>

  <li>Correct a broken connection</li>

  <li>Disconnect from the database connection</li>

</ul>

<ol>

  <li>To open a new connection: 

    <ul>

      <li>In the contextual menu for Databases or for any existing connection, 

        choose Add Connection.</li>

      <li> In the contextual menu for a driver, choose Connect Using to preselect 

        the driver.<br>

      </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>In the New Database Connection dialog box, ensure the correct driver is 

    selected in the Driver field. </li>

  <li>Provide the JDBC URL for the database connection in the Database URL field. 

    <p> This URL typically begins with <tt>jdbc:</tt>and a short code name 

      for the driver, followed by another colon. The rest of the URL depends on 

      the type of driver you are using. For example, you might need to specify 

      a host and port; alternatively, the name of a database file might suffice, 

      or an ODBC DSN. To help you get started, existing drivers are provided with 

      templates for the correct URL format. If in doubt, refer to the documentation 

      for the driver you are using. </p>

  </li>

  <li>Provide the user name and password, if required by your database configuration.</li>

  <li>Click the Remember Password checkbox to have the IDE remember your password. 

    <p> The password is saved only for the current the IDE session. After restarting 

      the IDE, yu must type the password again. This feature can be turned on 

      or off in the properties of each connected database in the Explorer. </p>

  </li>

  <li>Click OK to connect the IDE to the database. 

    <p>If the connection is successful, a new node appears on the same level as 

      Drivers. The icon for a connected database shows complete. If the connection 

      attempt fails, the IDE displays a dialog box indicating the connection 

      is broken. </p>

  </li>

</ol>

<p><b>To display schema information for a database:</b></p>

<ol>

  <li>Choose the Advanced tab on the New Database Connection panel.</li>

  <li>Select the schema to use with the database object by choosing it from the 

    combo box. This schema will be used with getter database objects such as tables 

    and views.</li>

  <li>Click OK.<br>

    <br>

    The database will connect to the database schema and the connection node in 

    the Databases folder. The IDE displays child folders of this connection node. 

    These Folders represent lists of tables, views and procedures.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>To correct a broken connection:</b></p>

<ol>

  <li>Correct the URL in the property sheet.</li>

  <li>Connect to the database from the contextual menu.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>To disconnect from the database connection</b>:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Choose Disconnect from the Connection contextual menu. 

    <p> You cannot browse the database until you reconnect to the database using 

      Connect. </p>

  </li>

</ul>
