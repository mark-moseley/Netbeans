<title>Connecting to a Database</title>

<body bgColor=#ffffff>
<h2>Connecting to a Database </h2>

<p>There are two ways to open the New connection dialog, which lets you connect
  Forte for Java to a database. </p>
<ol>
  <li>In the pop-up menu for Databases or for any existing connection, select
    Add connection.</li>
  <li> In the pop-up menu for a driver select Connect using... to preselect the
    driver.</li>
</ol>
<p> <b>Enter the following in the Connect using... dialog:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the correct driver is selected in Driver name. </li>
  <li> Provide the JDBC URL for the database connection in the Database URL. </li>
  <p>This URL typically begins with <code>jdbc:</code>, followed by a short code
    name for the driver, followed <br>
    by another colon.
  <p>The rest of the URL depends on the type of driver you are using. <br>
    For example, you might need to specify a host and port; alternatively, the
    name of a <br>
    database file might suffice, or an ODBC DSN.
  <p>To help you get started, existing drivers are provided with templates for
    the correct URL format;<br>
    if in doubt, refer to the documentation for the driver you are using.<br>
  </p>
  <li>Provide the User Name and Password, if required by your database configuration.</li>
  <li>Click the Remember Password check box to have the IDE remember your password.<br>
  </li>
  <table>
    <tr><!--"Tip" to be replaced by a gif-->
      <td valign="top" width="33"><b>Note</b></td>
      <td valign="top" align=left width="434"> The password is saved only for
        the current Forte for Java session;<br>
        after restarting Forte for Java the password must be entered again. <br>
        This feature can be turned on or off in the properties of each connected<br>
        database in the Explorer. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <li>Click OK to connect Forte for Java to the database.</li>
  <li>If the connection is successful, a new node appears on the same level as
    Drivers.<br>
    The icon for a<br>
    connected database shows complete. </li>
</ol>
<p>If the connection attempt fails, Forte for Java displays a dialog box indicating
  the connection is broken.</p>
<p> <b>To correct the connection:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> Correct the URL in the property sheet.</li>
  <li>Connect to the database from the Popup Menu.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To disconnect from the database connection</b>:</p>
<p> Choose Disconnect from the Connection Pop-up menu. You cannot browse<br>
  the database until you reconnect to the database using Connect.</p>
