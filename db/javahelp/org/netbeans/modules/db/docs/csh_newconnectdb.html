        <h2>New Database Connection Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>This dialog box enables you to supply the details to create a new database connection.

        You open this dialog box by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the Databases node in the Services window and choose New Connection.</li>
            <li>Right-click a driver node under the Databases node in the Services window and choose Connect Using.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you create a database connection, you supply the details needed to connect to a specific database.
        Depending on the database driver you are using, you need to supply some or all of the following database connection details. </p>
<p><b>Basic setting tab</b></p>
<ul>
                <li><b>Name.</b> Choose the registered JDBC driver from the drop-down list.
                The drop-down list only contains drivers registered with the IDE. 
                If your driver is not listed, you need to <a href="adddriver.html">add the JDBC driver</a> before
                you can connect to the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Host.</strong> Type the host for the database. Use <tt>localhost</tt> if the database is located on a local machine.</li>
                <li><strong>Port.</strong> Type the post to be used by the database connection.</li>
                <li>Database. Type the name of the database.</li>
                <li><b>Driver.</b> This field is automatically supplied based on the selected registered driver.</li>
                  <li><b>User Name.</b> Type user name for the database.</li>
                <li><b>Password.</b> Type the password for the database.</li>
                <li><b>Remember Password.</b> Select this if you want the IDE to remember your password.
                 If selected, you will not be prompted for the user name and password on subsequent connections to the database
                  and the Remember Password property is set to True.
                 To set the Remember Password property to False, right-click the database connection node
                  in the Services window and choose Properties and modify the property in the Properties window.
                <ul class="note">
            <li>Storing a password represents a potential security risk.
            Connection passwords are stored in an xml file in the <tt>config/Databases/Connections</tt> directory in the IDE user dir.
            Passwords are scrambled but they are not encrypted.
            For more about securing database passwords, see the following NetBeans FAQ:<p>
                <p><object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                <param name="content" value="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/FaqSecuringDBConnectionPasswords">
                <param name="text" value="<html><u>How do I secure my database password?</u></html>">
                <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                <param name="textColor" value="blue">
                </object>
            </li>
        </ul></li>
            <li><b>Show JDBC URL.</b> When you select this checkbox, the IDE displays the JDBC URL in the text field. This can be useful for identifying the database connection. Ths URL resembles ths following URL:
              <p><pre>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase</pre></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
<p><b>Advanced tab</b></p>                 
<p>In the Advanced tab of the New Database Connection dialog box, you select the database schema                 
                




you want to use for your connection. The Database Explorer displays only tables that use the selected schema. 
<ul class="note">
  <li><b>Note: </b>A schema does not appear in the Select Schema drop down list until you first create an object in the schema.</li>
</ul> 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Get Schemas.</b> When you click Get Schemas, all schemas associated with the database are displayed in the drop down list. If no schemas are found, the drop down list remains grayed out.</li>
</ul>
