        <h2>New Database Connection Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>This dialog box enables you to supply the details to create a new database connection.

        You open this dialog box by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the Databases node in the Services window and choose New Connection.</li>
            <li>Right-click a driver node under the Databases node in the Services window and choose Connect Using.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you create a database connection, you supply the details needed to connect to a specific database.
        You need to supply the following database connection details.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Name.</b> Choose the registered JDBC driver from the drop-down list.
                The drop-down list only contains drivers registered with the IDE. 
                If your driver is not listed, you need to <a href="adddriver.html">add the JDBC driver</a> before
                you can connect to the database.</li>
                <li><b>Driver.</b> This field is automatically supplied based on the selected registered driver.</li>
                <li><b>Database URL.</b> Type the JDBC database URL for the database connection. 
                <p>This URL typically begins with <tt>jdbc:</tt>and a short code name 
                for the driver, followed by another colon. The rest of the URL depends on 
                the type of driver you are using. For example, you might need to specify 
                a host and port; alternatively, the name of a database file might suffice, 
                or an ODBC DSN. For MySQL, the Database URL might look as follows:
                <pre>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase</pre>
                To help you get started, the IDE provides templates for the correct URL format for
                the most common drivers. If in doubt, refer to the documentation 
                for the driver that you are using. </p></li>
                <li><b>User Name.</b> Type user name for the database.</li>
                <li><b>Password.</b> Type the password for the database.</li>
                <li><b>Remember Password.</b> Select this if you want the IDE to remember your password. 
                  <p>If selected, you will not be prompted for the user name and password on subsequent connections to the database
                and the Remember Password property is set to True.</p> 
                <p>To set the Remember Password property to False, right-click the database connection node
                in the Services window and choose Properties and modify the property in the Properties window.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Storing a password represents a potential security risk.
            Connection passwords are stored in an xml file in the <tt>config/Databases/Connections</tt> directory in the IDE user dir.
            Passwords are scrambled but they are not encrypted.
            <p>For more about securing database passwords, see the following NetBeans FAQ:<p>
