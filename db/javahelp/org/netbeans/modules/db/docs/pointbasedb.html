<h2>Connecting to a Pointbase Database</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The Pointbase database was the sample database bundled with Sun Java System Application Server 8.1.</p>
<p>When you install the Sun Java System Application Server 8.1, the Pointbase database JDBC 
drivers are installed and the Pointbase Database Server is installed into 
the <tt>Sun/AppServer/pointbase</tt> directory. The following sample databases
are installed with the Pointbase installation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><tt>sample</tt></li>
        <li><tt>sun-appserv-samples</tt></li>
    </ul>
<p>When you register an instance of Sun Java System Application Server 8.1 in the IDE, 
the sample databases are registered in the Runtime window and the
 Pointbase Database menu appears in the Tools menu. You can use the commands in the 
 Pointbase Database menu to start and stop the Pointbase database.</p>    
    
    <b>To connect to the Pointbase sample database:</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure the Pointbase Database Server is running. You can start the database server by choosing 
        Tools &gt; Pointbase Database &gt; Start Local Pointbase Database.
        A message appears in the Output window confirming that the Pointbase server has started and
        which port the server is listening on.</li>
        <li>In the Runtime window, expand the Databases node and the Drivers node.</li>
        <li>Right-click the Pointbase driver node and choose Connect Using.</li>
        <li>In the New Database Connection dialog box, ensure that Pointbase is selected as the name in the drop-down menu and that the Driver field contains the 
        Pointbase driver:<br><tt>com.pointbase.jdbc.jdbcUniversalDriver</tt>.</li>
        <li>Enter the URL of the Pointbase database. The URL format is given in the textbox:<br>
        <tt>jdbc:pointbase://&lt;HOST&gt;[:&lt;PORT&gt;]/&lt;DB&gt;</tt>
        <p>To connect to the sample Pointbase database bundled with the default Sun Java System Application Server installation,
        the URL should look like this:<br>
        <tt>jdbc:pointbase://localhost:9092/sample</tt></p></li>
        <li>Enter the User name and Password. The username / password for the sample database is
        pbpublic / pbpublic.</li>
        
        <li>Click OK.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Selecting Remember password will store the password for the current IDE session. 
    If left unselected, a dialog box appears prompting you for the password every time you 
    connect to the database.</li>
    <li>If the Pointbase Server is not available, make sure that your Sun Java System Application 
    Server is listed in the Runtime window in the Servers node. For more, see 
    <a 
    href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.j2ee.sun.appsrv81/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/sun/ide/docs/general/register_appserver.html">Registering a Java System Application Server Instance</a></li>
    <li>You cannot create a new database on the Pointbase Database server from within the IDE.</li> 
</ul>
