<h2>Viewing Data </h2>
<p>Viewing data is an important function you can perform with the Database Explorer.</p>
<p> <b>To view data of a table or view:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Right-click on the node of the table or view.
  <li>Select View data from the context menu. A dialog with a default SQL command<br>
    to select all data from the table will appear. 
  <li>Edit the SQL command or enter a different command.
  <li> Press Fetch to run the query.
  <li> Examine the results in the spreadsheet-like view. Forte for Java remembers 
    all commands you<br>
    enter in a drop-down box for later use. 
</ul>
<p> Each column node has the same View data item in its pop-up menu.<br>
  This functionality is similar to the functionality for tables, however,<br>
  when you view tables, the SQL query for viewing data fetches only the one column.</p>
