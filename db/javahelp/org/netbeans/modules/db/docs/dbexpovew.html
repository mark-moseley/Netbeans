        When you open the Runtime window, you can use the Databases node to perform the following
        simple operations related to JDBC-compliant databases within the IDE.
        You can view the current structure of tables and their data 
        while you are developing database applications or applets.
        <p>Within the Databases node you can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect to a database.</li>
            <li>View current database connections.</li> 
            <li>Select or add a driver for your database.</li>
            <li>Create, browse and edit database structures.</li>
            <li>Enter SQL statements and see the results immediately.</li>
            <li>Migrate table schemas across databases from different vendors.</li>
        </ul>
        <table>
