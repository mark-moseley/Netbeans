<h2>Adding a New Driver</h2>
<p> You can add any one of the predefined drivers by choosing Databases <img src="arrow.gif" width="5" height="11">Drivers 
  in the Runtime tab of the Explorer). After you add a driver, you can test the 
  driver to ensure that it is compatible with the Database Explorer. 
<p> <b>To add your own driver:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Runtime tab of the Explorer, expand the Databases node. </li>
  <li>Right-click the Drivers node or a specific driver under the Drivers node, 
    choose Add Driver. </li>
  <li>In the Add Driver dialog box, specify a driver name for the new driver. 
    <p> The IDE uses this name only for display purposes. </p>
  </li>
  <li>In the Driver field, provide the fully qualified driver class name. For 
    example:
    <p> <code>COM.pointbase.jdbc.jdbcUniversalDriver</code>. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Provide the URL for example: 
    <p> <code>jdbc:pointbase://localhost:9092/sample</code><eul> </p>
  </li>
  <li> In the Database URL prefix field, type a template for the URLs of connections 
    you want to make using this driver. 
    <p> The template can represent a URL that is not the real URL; you can complete 
      the URL later when you connect. For example, you can now add: <code>jdbc:pointbase://&lt;HOST&gt;[:PORT]/[DB]/<db> 
      </code> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK to add the new driver to the list. 
    <p> Later, you can remove a driver by selecting it in the Explorer, right-clicking, 
      and choosing Delete, or you can open the property sheet and modify its configurations. 
      You can also remove the driver using the keyboard.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

    <td valign=top align=left>Adding a new driver just creates a template for 
      new connections. The IDE does not actually try to use that driver or check 
      to make sure it is the correct one until a connection is made using the 
      driver. 
      <p><br>
        The driver (usually in a JAR or zip archive) must be in the IDE's CLASSPATH.
