        <h2>Adding a New Driver</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <ol>

            <li>In the Runtime window, expand the Databases node. </li>

            <li>Right-click the Drivers node and choose Add Driver. </li>

            <li>In the Add JDBC Driver dialog box, click the Add button to open a file
                chooser. Then navigate to and select the archive files of the driver that you
                want to add. 

                <p>Once you choose a valid archive file, the Driver Class and
                the Name fields should be filled in by the IDE.</p>

            </li>

            <li>If the Driver Class field is empty or incorrect, click Find.
                The IDE will search the archive files that you selected in the 
                previous step and find all classes that implement the JDBC
                API Driver interface (<tt>java.sql.Driver</tt>). The Driver 
                Class combo box lists the classes that the IDE finds. Use the 
                combo box to select the driver class that you need.

            </li>

            <li>In the Name field, type a descriptive name for the new driver. 

            <p> The IDE uses this name only for display purposes. </p></li>
            <li>Click OK to add the new driver to the list. </li>

        </ol>

        <p>You can remove a driver by right-clicking its node in the Runtime
        window and choosing Delete.</p>
        <p>You can modify a driver's configurations by right-clicking the driver's node
        and choosing Customize.</p>

  

        <ul class="note"><li>Adding a new driver just creates a template for 
            new connections. The IDE does not actually try to use that driver or check 
            to make sure it is the correct one until a connection is made using the driver. 
        </li></ul>
