        <h2>Adding a JDBC Driver</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>To connect to a database from within the IDE, you need to register an appropriate JDBC driver for the database with the IDE.</p>
        <p>If the JDBC driver for your database is not registered with the IDE, you can add the driver in the Services window. 
        Registered drivers (&nbsp;<img src="images/driverPrefered.gif" alt="installed driver, preferred">&nbsp;) are listed under Drivers under the Databases node in the Services window.</p> 
        
        <p><b>To add a JDBC driver:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Services window, expand the Databases node. </li>
            <li>Right-click the Drivers node and choose New Driver. </li>
            <li>In the Add JDBC Driver dialog box, click the Add button to open a file
                chooser. Then navigate to and select the archive files of the driver that you
                want to add. 

                <p>Once you choose a valid archive file, the Driver Class and
                the Name fields should be filled in by the IDE.</p>
            </li>

            <li>If the Driver Class field is empty or incorrect, click Find.
                The IDE will search the archive files that you selected in the 
                previous step and find all classes that implement the JDBC
                API Driver interface (<tt>java.sql.Driver</tt>). The Driver 
                Class combo box lists the classes that the IDE finds. Use the 
                combo box to select the driver class that you need.</li>
            <li>In the Name field, type a descriptive name for the new driver. 
            <p>The IDE uses this name for display purposes. </p></li>
            <li>Click OK to add the new driver to the list of registered drivers. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>After the JDBC driver for your database is registered, you can then create a database connection.
        The IDE uses the database connection information when creating database resources and <a href="connectdb.html">connecting to a database</a>.</p>
  
        <ul class="note"><li>Adding a new driver just creates a template for 
            new connections. The IDE does not actually try to use that driver or check 
            to make sure it is correct until a connection is made using the driver. 
        </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        An uninstalled driver node (&nbsp;<img src="images/driverPreferedNotInstalled.gif" alt="preferred driver which is not installed">&nbsp;)
        is displayed in the Services window if a driver is registered with the IDE but the archive JAR file for the driver is not currently on the IDE's class path.
        In this case, you should remove the driver or modify the driver's properties to specify the correct location of the JAR file for the driver.</p>
        <p><b>To remove a driver:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the driver node in the Services window and choose Delete.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><b>To modify a driver's configurations:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right-click the driver's node and choose Customize.</li>
        </ul>
