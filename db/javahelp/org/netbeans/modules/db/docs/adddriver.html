<title>Adding a New Driver</title>
</head>

<body bgColor=#ffffff>
<h2>Adding a New Driver</h2>

You can add any one of the predefined drivers available under Runtime | Databases
| Drivers. <br>
After you add a driver, you can test the driver to ensure that it is compatible
with Database Explorer.
<p> <b>To add your own driver:</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Right click on Drivers or a specific driver under Drivers.</li>
  <li>Choose Add driver. A dialog appears to enable you to add a new driver.</li>
  <li>Specify a Driver name for the new driver. The IDE uses this name only
      for display purposes. </li>
  <li>In the Driver URL, provide the fully qualified driver class name, for example:<br>
    <code>COM.pointbase.jdbc.jdbcUniversalDriver</code>. 
  <li>Provide the URL, for example:<br>
    <code>jdbc:pointbase://embedded[:<PORT>]/<DB></code>.
    <eul> 
<table>
 <tr><!--"Tip" to be replaced by a gif-->
      <td valign="top" width="30" height="37"><b><img src="images/tip.gif" width="12" height="12"></b></td>
       <td valign="top" align=left height="37"> The driver (usually in a JAR
          or ZIP archive) must be in the Forte for Java CLASSPATH..</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li> In the Database URL prefix, enter a template for the URLs of connections
    you want to make <br>
    using this driver. The template can represent a URL that is not the real URL;
    you can complete the URL later<br>
    when you connect. For example, you can now add <code>jdbc:pointbase://embedded[:<PORT>]/<DB>
    </code> </li>
  <li>Click OK to add the new driver to the list. </li>
  <li> Later, you can remove drivers by selecting them in the Explorer and pressing
    Delete, <br>
    or you can open the<br>
    property sheet and modify their configuration. </li>
</ol>
<p> Note: Adding a new driver just creates a template for new connections; Forte
  for Java does not actually try to <br>
  use that driver or check to make sure it is the correct one until a connection
  is made using the driver.. </p>

<p> <b>To test a connected driver:</b>
<ol>
  <li> Right-click on the driver or connection in the Explorer and select Test
    Driver from the context menu.
  <li> In the dialog that appears, enter the connection information (database
    URL, user name,<br>
    and password) and click OK.
  <li>If all values shown in the output correspond with the actual database, you
    can use the drive.
  <li> If an "unsupported exception" appears, test to make sure that the data
    displayed in the output window is<br>
    valid -- for example, that the number of tables or columns in the table corresponds
    with the actual data
</ol>

    <td valign="top" align=left height="37"> The system returns the "Internal
      test driver failed" message whenever it finds a return value of 0<br>
      or an exception. If your database is empty or a table has no foreign references,
      the driver might<br>
      not be the problem.</td>
