        <title>For sale: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling</title>
        <description>Ten years after Potter-mania first swept the globe, the epic series draws to a close with HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, the hotly anticipated seventh and final book of the internationally revered Harry Potter series. Prophecies will be fulfilled. Beloved characters will die. Questions will be answered. (Is Dumbledore really gone forever? Who is R.A.B.? Is Severus Snape truly a villain?) In this final volume, Harrys seemingly impossible quest is to discover the locations of the remaining horcruxes--items sacred to Lord Voldemort containing shreds of his soul, making him immortal--and destroy them, saving the world from becoming a Death Eaters paradise where Muggles are prey and purebloods rule. Accompanied by Ron and Hermione, Harry embarks on a dangerous, confusing, and often frustrating journey to discover the horcruxes. The trio is repeatedly in dire straits, making their mission seem, at times, doomed.Throughout the series, author J. K. Rowling has been steadily escalating events towards the climatic battle between Harry and the Dark Lord, and numerous seemingly trivial details from the previous novels play important roles--proof of Rowling's masterly control of the sprawling and multi-layered "wizarding world" she has invented. By far the darkest of the novels, this impressive finale shows Harry bereft of his godfather Sirius Black, the wise and secretive Dumbledore, and even his friends, forced to truly grow up and face a fight where he is the sole lynchpin in the battle between righteousness and a nearly omnipotent evil. With modern problems re-imagined in a magical setting, echoes of Christianity, and an unwavering faith in goodness, Rowlings epic saga will remain a childrens classic for generations to come. Raquel adds: A MUST READ! If you haven't read it yet, get to it soon before your friends ruin it for you! Powered by muze(r). MuzeBooks(tm) and Out of Print MuzeBooks(tm) Copyright 2007.

        <title>For sale: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J. K. Rowling</title>
        <description>As Harry Potter begins his third year as a student at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, he is disturbed to discover that Sirius Black, a wizard who may have been involved with the death of his parents, has escaped from Azkaban Prison. Black left behind two clues, both of which indicate that he is headed for Hogwarts--and Harry. As a result, the school is being watched over by the Dementors, a terrifying sect of black-cloaked guards from the Azkaban Prison--whose very presence at Hogwarts has a potentially life-threatening effect on Harry. Meanwhile, he gets acquainted with Professor Lupin, Hogwarts's new teacher of Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Harry also wonders about his new teacher's secretive relationship with Professor Snape. This is the third entry in the wildly popular Harry Potter series of books, and a film version directed by Alfonso Cuaron was made in 2004. Vincent adds: Read once -- it is basically like new.

        <title>For sale: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J. K. Rowling</title>
        <description>Packed with mystery, subterfuge, and a more intimate understanding of the challenges that lie ahead of him, Harry Potters sixth year at Hogwarts heaves with his growing sense of responsibility regarding the defeat of Lord Voldemort, a relentlessly sneaking suspicion that classmate Draco Malfoy is a Death Eater in cahoots with the dastardly Professor Snape, and a host of romantic entanglements that hilariously plague everyone. Harrys busy N.E.W.T.-level schedule includes Potions, where he surprises himself by excelling due to strangely helpful, hand-written margin notes in his book, ascribed only to the enigmatic "Half-Blood Prince." Sporadic, private lessons with Dumbledore center on the personal history of Lord Voldemort, which both unnerves and fascinates Harry. At the same time, the romantic ups and downs of Ron and Hermione threaten to destroy their friendship. The sixth installation in the phenomenally successful Harry Potter series opened with record-breaking sales of an estimated 6.9 million books on July 16, 2005. Named both one of Publishers Weekly's Best Children's Books of 2005 and a New York Times Notable Book of 2005. Vincent adds: Read once -- it is basically like new. No marks or highlight.
