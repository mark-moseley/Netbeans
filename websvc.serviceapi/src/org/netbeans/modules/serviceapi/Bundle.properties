OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Web Services
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Service API defines a contract for introspecting development environment entities to discover components providing and consuming web services.  \
    ServiceAPI is abstract enough to allow service interface to be specified with different web service description standards (WSDL, WADL, ...).  \
    Also, each service component could be rendered with specific visualization of the underlying implementation technology such as Servlet, Enterprise Java Bean (EJB), Business Process (BPEL),... \n\
    Aside from discovery and visualization, Service API also specifies capabilities for creation of service implementation skeletons, as well as identifying possible service connections.
