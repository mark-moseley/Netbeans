<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Service API</H1>
<P>Service API defines a contract for introspecting development
environment entities to discover components providing and consuming
web services. ServiceAPI is abstract enough to allow service
interface to be specified with different web service description
standards (WSDL, WADL, ...). Also, each service component could be
rendered with specific visualization of the underlying implementation
technology such as Servlet, Enterprise Java Bean (EJB), Business
Process (BPEL),... 
</P>
<P>Aside from discovery and visualization, Service API also specifies
capabilities for creation of service implementation skeletons, as
well as identifying possible service connections. 
</P>
<P>Following are entities defined by this API:

</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><I>ServiceInterface</I> represents an abstract service
	endpoint encapsulating a interface and its service aspect, whether
	it is of provider end or consumer end. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>ServiceComponent</I> defines service implementation unit
	of one or multiple interfaces but collocate in a single physical
	file such as a plain Java class, a BPEL process, an EJB or Servlet
	class... 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>ServiceModule</I> contains multiple service components.
	Service module corresponds to service-unit in JBI deployment or
	runtime environment. There are differen types of service modules
	based on the underlying service implementation technology: BPEL, XSL
	Transform, JavaEE and plain Java. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>ServiceModuleContainer</I> is a compound service module,
	could contains multiple child service modules. 
	</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT><I>IntegrationContainer</I> is a service module
	container with design-time provider-consumer relationships between
	service interfaces from its child modules. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Development projects expose service composition capabilities
through project lookup. Designer editor should be able to obtain one
instance of <I>ServiceModule</I> or <I>IntegrationContainer</I> from
the project lookup.
