  <h1>Single Page CRUD with Table Read Me</h1>
  
<p>Single Page Crud with Table is a simple example that demonstrates how to 
perform database operations, all on one page, using Netbeans 6.  
These operations include creating new entries, deleting an existing 
entries, updating existing entries, and of course retrieving the information 
from a database. </p>

<p>	The data consists of fictitious trips taken by fictitious employees.  
Just select a person from the drop-down list and that person's job title 
is displayed along with a table showing trips that have been taken by that 
person.  Simply mark checkboxes corresponding to any trip you want to 
delete and select Delete to permanently remove them.  Modify any 
information in the table itself and select Update to change the information.  
To add a new trip, fill in the form below the table and select Add, 
the new trip is displayed as a new row at the bottom of the table.  
This example also demonstrates data binding to components and makes use 
of Data Providers as well as row sets.</p>
