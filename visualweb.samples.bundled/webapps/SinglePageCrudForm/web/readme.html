  <h1>Single Page CRUD With Form Read Me</h1>
  <p>SinglePageCrudForm is a sample application that demonstrates how to perform database operations (create, read, update, and delete),
all on one page, using Netbeans 6.  
These operations include creating new database records, deleting an existing entries, updating existing entries, and of course retrieving the information 
from a database. All the data is displayed one record at a time in a simple form consisting of JavaServer (tm) Faces components.</p>

<p>The data consists of fictitious trips taken by fictitious employees.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Trips are shown for the currently selected Person. To see another person's trips, select a different Person in the drop-down list.</li>
    <li>To navigate to another trip, use the VCR controls under the Person drop-down list.</li>
    <li>To create a new trip for the selected person:
       <ol>
       <li>Select Create :- this appends a new blank trip at the end of the current trips.</li>
       <li>Fill in the data in the trips form.</li>
       <li>Select Save to save the data to the database.</li>
       <li>(Optionally, you can select Cancel Create to throw away any changes.)</li>
       </ol></li>
   <li>To delete a trip, navigate to it using the VCR controls if necessary, and select Delete.</li>
   <li>To change any of the data in the currently selected trip, edit the data and select Save.</li>
</ul>
