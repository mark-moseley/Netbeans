<h1>Travel Center Sample Application Read Me</h1>
  
<p>This application demonstrates the data-binding capabilities
offered by the Netbeans 6 visual web user experience.</p>

<p>You can drag and drop a datasource such as a database
table and bind it to JavaServer Faces components to
display the information. In the <tt>Page1.jsp</tt> of this application the
DropDown List component and the Table component are bound to the Person
and Trip tables respectively of the sample Travel database bundled with the IDE.
Please switch to the Java view of <tt>Page1</tt> to see how event handling is
being carried out in this page. </p>

<p>In the TripDetails page, the Flight, Auto Rental, and Hotel tables are bound to the 
Fligh, CarRental, and Hotel tables respectively. See the <i>init()</i> method in the
TripDetails Java file to view how the data providers are getting
refreshed every time a new trip is selected.</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>You must have Glasfish V2 installed, and you should have the sample Travel started 
before opening the application.</p>
