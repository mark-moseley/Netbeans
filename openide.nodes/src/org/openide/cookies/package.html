<a href="../nodes/doc-files/api.html"><em>Cookies</em></a>

are a design pattern used to add behaviors to existing data object
and nodes, or to separate implementation from the main object.

<p>The <b>Loaders API</b>
describes how to use cookies in conjunction with data objects,
including creating new cookie interfaces, creating new cookie support
implementations, and reusing existing supports. The

<a href="../nodes/doc-files/api.html"><b>Nodes API</b></a>

also permits use of cookies to add behavior to nodes.
