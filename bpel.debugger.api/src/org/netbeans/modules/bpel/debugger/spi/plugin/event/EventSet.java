/**
 * A container for one or more
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.Event}
 * objects.
 * Several
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.Event}
 * objects may be generated at a given time by the BPEL Engine.
 * For example, there may be more than one
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.request.BreakpointReachedRequest}
 * for a given
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.def.Position}
 * or you might single step to the same
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.def.Position}
 * as a
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.request.BreakpointReachedRequest}.
 * These
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.Event}
 * objects are delivered together as an EventSet.
 * For uniformity, an EventSet is always used to deliver
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.Event}
 * objects.
 * EventSets are delivered by the
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.EventQueue}.
 * EventSets are unmodifiable.
 * <br><br>
 * Associated with the issuance of an event set, process instance suspensions
 * may have occurred in the target BPEL Engine. These suspensions correspond
 * with the
 * {@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.request.EventRequest.SuspendPolicy}.
 * <br>
 * The events that are in an EventSet are restricted in the following ways:
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>Always singleton sets:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.BpelEngineDisconnectedEvent}
 *      </ul>
 *    <li>Only with other ProcessInstanceCreatedEvents for the same process instance:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.ProcessInstanceCreatedEvent}
 *      </ul>
 *    <li>Only with other ProcessInstanceCompletedEvents for the same process instance:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.ProcessInstanceCompletedEvent}
 *      </ul>
 *    <li>Only with other members of this group, at the same position and in the same scope instance:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.BreakpointReachedEvent}
 *      <li>{@link org.netbeans.modules.bpel.debugger.spi.plugin.event.StepCompletedEvent}
 *      </ul>
