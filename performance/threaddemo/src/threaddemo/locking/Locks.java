     * Pseudo-lock that allows code to be synchronized with the AWT event dispatch thread.
     * This is handy in that you can define a constant of type Lock in some API, initially
     * set to a normal lock, and then switch everything to the event thread (or vice-versa).
     * <p>It behaves somewhat differently from a read-write lock.
     * <ol>
     * <li>There is no distinction between read and write access. There is only one
     *     access mode, which is exclusive, and runs on the AWT thread, not in the
     *     caller thread.
     * <li>There is no {@link PrivilegedLock}, so you cannot make entry or exit calls
     *     by themselves (which would make no sense).
     * <li>You cannot specify a level. The event lock is considered to be at a higher
     *     level than any ordinary lock with a defined level. This means that from the
     *     event thread, you can enter any lock (subject to other restrictions), but
     *     while holding any <em>ordered</em> lock you may not block on the event thread
     *     (using <code>Locks.eventLock</code> methods).
     * <li>{@link Lock#read(LockAction)}, {@link Lock#read(LockExceptionAction)},
     *     {@link Lock#write(LockAction)}, {@link Lock#write(LockExceptionAction)},
     *     {@link Lock#read(Runnable)}, and {@link Lock#write(Runnable)} when called from the
     *     event thread run synchronously. Else they all block, like
     *     {@link java.awt.EventQueue#invokeAndWait}.
     * <li>{@link Lock#readLater(Runnable)} and {@link Lock#writeLater(Runnable)} run asynchronously, like
     *     {@link java.awt.EventQueue#invokeLater}.
     * <li>{@link Lock#canRead} and {@link Lock#canWrite} just test whether you are in the event
     *     thread, like {@link java.awt.EventQueue#isDispatchThread}.
