 * Ability to acquire or release a lock by itself.
 * This class can be used when one wants to avoid creating a
 * bunch of Runnables. Instead use:
 * <pre>
 * p.enter*();
 * try {
 *     // your code here
 * } finally {
 *     p.exit*();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * You must be careful to match enter and exit calls reliably and exactly.
 * Please read the Javadoc for each method carefully.
 *
 * <p>You must control the related Lock, i.e. you must be the creator of
 * the Lock. Thus you may create a PrivilegedLock for efficient access within
 * a package and only expose the lock to outside code, to ensure that it is
 * not abused by being entered and not exited.
