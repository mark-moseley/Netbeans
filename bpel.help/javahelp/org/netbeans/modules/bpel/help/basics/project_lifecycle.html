<h2>Understanding Service Oriented Architecture Projects</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p> When working with BPEL processes, you typically use the following types of Service Oriented Architecture projects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>BPEL Module project </li>
  <li>Composite Application project  </li>
</ul>
<p>In the New Project wizard, these projects are available in the SOA category. </p>
<p><b>BPEL Module</b><b> P</b><b>roject</b></p>
<p>BPEL Module project is a group of source files which includes BPEL files, web service interface files (<tt>.wsdl</tt>), and XML Schema (<tt>.xsd</tt>) files. Within a BPEL Module project, you can author a business process  compliant with the WS-BPEL 2.0 language specification.  </p>
<p><b>Composite Application Project</b></p>
<p> Composite Application project is a project whose primary purpose is  to assemble a deployment unit for the Java Business  Integration (JBI) server. The JBI server can contain different service  engines. One service engine is the BPEL Service Engine. BPEL  Module projects must be added to a Composite Application project in order to be  deployed to the BPEL runtime. The Composite Application Project can  also be used to create and execute test cases that can then be run, in  JUnit fashion, against the deployed BPEL processes. </p>
<p><b>Sample BPEL Module and Composite Application projects</b></p>
<p>Using the New Project wizard,   you can also create the following  sample SOA projects. Each of these samples is  really a pair of related projects, a BPEL Module and a Composite  Application project. Use the New Project wizard to create these  samples. Then deploy and test-run the samples. If you wish, you can  also use a sample as a starting point for new development.   You can create the following sample projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Synchronous sample process</li>
  <li>Asynchronous sample process </li>
  <li>Travel Reservation Service sample </li>
</ul>
