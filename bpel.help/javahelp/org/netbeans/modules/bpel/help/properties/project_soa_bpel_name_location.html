<h2>New BPEL Module Wizard: Name and Location</h2>
<p>The New Project wizard steps you through the process of creating a new project.
   You open the wizard by choosing File &gt; New Project and selecting the BPEL Module project template from the 
   SOA category. 
<p>The Name and Location page of the wizard prompts you to supply information 
characterizing the BPEL Module project you are creating:</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Project Name.</b> 
      Supply a name for the folder that will contain your BPEL Module files.
  </li>

  <li><b>Project Location.</b> 
      Keep the default path to your other projects, or specify a new one.
  </li>

  <li>Project Folder <em>(not settable).</em> 
      The system derives this value by concatenating the previous two entries.
  </li>

  <li><b>Set as Main Project.</b> 
       Keep this check box selected unless you want a different project to be 
       regarded as the main project.
  </li>

</ul>
<p>
  When you click Finish, the project is created on your computer and opened 
  in both the Projects window and the Files window.
