<h2>About the Design View of the BPEL Designer </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<!--Add See also links to Orch palette topics, clarify about Reverse Engineering? -->
<p>The Design view is where you can visually author a diagram of your business process by adding, editing, and deleting BPEL elements. The diagram constructed in the Design view is  automatically generated into BPEL source code compliant with the BPEL 2.0 language specification.  </p>
<p>The Design view opens by default when you open a BPEL source file from a BPEL Module project in the Projects window. When a BPEL file is open in the Design view, the elements you can use to construct your diagram are displayed on the BPEL Designer Palette.</p>
<p>If you are doing forward engineering,  drag  element icons from the BPEL Designer Palette and drop them directly on the Design view area. The IDE automatically generates the BPEL code that corresponds to the diagram in the Design view. For reverse engineering,  modifications of the source code are converted to their graphic representations on the diagram when you switch to the Design view. </p>
<p><b>To open a BPEL file in the Design view:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Projects window, expand the BPEL Module project's node and double-click the BPEL source file (<tt>.bpel</tt>). <br>
  The file opens in the Editing Mode of the Design view by default. </li>
</ul>
<p>When working with BPEL process diagrams, the following IDE windows help you design and navigate on the diagrams. If these windows do not open automatically when you open a BPEL file in the Design view, open them from the Window menu: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigator (Ctrl-7) </li>
  <li>Palette (Ctrl-Shift-8) </li>
  <li>Properties (Ctrl-Shift-7) </li>
</ul>
