<h2>About the BPEL Designer Source View</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<!-- Check whether other limitations are imposed on saving files in source view -->
<p>The Source view, sometimes also referred to as the Source Editor, shows the underlying code for a business process diagram. You can use the Source view to edit the  the business process source code. The Source view is based on the  IDE's XML 
Source view and provides access to conveniences such as code folding, XML syntax highlighting, and code completion.</p>
<h3>Automating the Start of a Business Process </h3>
<p>You can use the Source view to write an entire business process in BPEL 
  code, but there is no need to do so. Business process elements that represent process 
  activities can be dragged and dropped from the BPEL Designer Palette in the Design view. You can use property sheets, custom editors, and pop-up menus to configure individual 
  elements and use the Source view only to add details to the existing code.</p>
<p>By using the automated features of the BPEL Designer as much 
as possible, you ensure that the  code is well-formed and that your 
business process is compliant with the WS-BPEL 2.0 specification.</p>
<h3>Keeping a Process Diagram and Its Source Code in Sync</h3>
<p>The BPEL Designer  supports a full round-trip engineering cycle, which includes both forward and reverse engineering. In the BPEL Designer, the graphic diagrams and code are always kept in sync. </p>
<p>To view the diagram that corresponds to the source code, place the curson on the line of code and choose Go To Design from the pop-up menu. </p>
<p> To save changes you made while editing the source code, choose File &gt; Save (Ctrl-S). </p>
<p>To undo changes you made while editing the source code, choose Edit &gt; Undo (Ctrl-Z)</p>
<h3>Using Code Completion</h3>
<p>While you are typing in the Source view, the code completion feature helps you fill in code and tags.  You can complete an expression by selecting the appropriate choice from a list of possible tags and BPEL constructs. In the Source view of the BPEL Designer, the code completion feature is similar to code completion in XML files.
