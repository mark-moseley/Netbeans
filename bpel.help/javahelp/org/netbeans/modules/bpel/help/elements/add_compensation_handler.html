<h2>BPEL Designer: Adding Compensation Handlers </h2>

<p><span lang="EN">A business process often contains several nested transactions. The overall  business transaction can fail or be cancelled after many enclosed transactions have  already been processed. Then it is necessary to </span><span lang="EN">reverse the  effect obtained during  process execution. <span lang="EN">For example, a travel planning process can include several nested transactions to book a ticket, to reserve a hotel and a car. If the trip is cancelled, the reservation transactions must be compensated  for by cancellation transactions in the appropriate order.</span> For such cases, WS-BPEL provides you with the capability to define compensation actions.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">A C</span>ompensation Handler <span lang="EN"> is a container for the activities that  perform compensation actions. </span>You can add one Compensation Handler  to either the  Scope or the Invoke elements. The compensation handler can be invoked by <a href="compensatescope.html">Compensate Scope</a> or <a href="compensate.html">Compensate</a> activity. </p>
<p><b>To add a Compensation Handler  to Scope or Invoke elements:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the Scope or Invoke element  and choose Add &gt;  Compensation Handler.<br>
  An empty container element appears. </li>
  <li>From the Palette, drag one or several activities that will be  executed and place them inside the Compensation Handler container. Configure the properties of each activity. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
