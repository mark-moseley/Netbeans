<h2>Receive</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p><span lang="EN">A business process provides  services to its partners through associated Receive and Reply activities. </span>The Receive activity causes the process to wait for a matching message to arrive from a partner service. The process 
cannot continue or end until it receives a matching message from the partner service. Thus, the attributes of the R<span lang="EN">eceive activity are the Partner Link, the port type (optional), and the operation that the partner is expected to invoke. </span></p>
<p>The Receive activity is also used to start a business process instance. For this initial Receive element, the <tt>createInstance</tt> attribute must be set to <tt>yes</tt>. If there are other Receive activities in your process, their <tt>createInstance</tt> attributes should be set to <tt>no</tt>. </p>
<p><b>To use the Receive element</b>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Design view, drag the Receive element from the Palette to the diagram.</li>
  <li>Right-click the Receive element on the diagram and choose Edit.</li>
  <li>In the Property Editor dialog box, configure the following:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name</b>. Enter an arbitrary name. </li>
      <li><b>Partner Link</b>. Select the Partner Link that should send an inbound message. Another way to associate a Partner Link with the Receive activity is to draw a <a href="../design/change_message_flow.html" title="Changing Message Flows">message flow</a> on the diagram.</li>
      <li><b>Operation</b>. Define the operation to be associated with the Receive element. The operation is already defined in the partner WSDL file, so you can  select it from the drop-down list.</li>
      <li><b>Input Variable</b>. Create a new variable or use an existing variable to hold the received message and transport it for consequent operations. </li>
      <li><b>Create Instance</b> (Optional). Select this checkbox to set the Create Instance attribute to <tt>yes</tt> if this Receive element starts the business process.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>The Receive element is now configured to wait for a message from a partner web service. </p>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
<li>Alternatively, you can configure these properties in the Properties window. See <a href="../design/ww_diagram_element_props.html" title="Configuring Element Properties">Configuring Element Properties</a> for more detail. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding Correlation Sets</h3>
<p>You can add the correlation sets defined for the Scope and Process elements to a Receive element. Before adding a correlation set to Receive, make sure that at least one <a href="../design/create_correlation_set.html" title="Adding Correlation Sets">correlation set</a> has been defined for the parent Scope or the entire Process. </p>
<p><b>To add a correlation set to Receive:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Design view, right-click the Receive element and choose Edit.</li>
  <li>In the Property Editor, select the Correlations tab and
    click Add. </li>
  <li>In the Choose a Correlation Set dialog box, expand the
    Correlation Sets node, select the correlation set and click OK.</li>
  <li>Choose the initiate attribute for this correlation set from the Initiate drop-down list. You can select one of the following options: <br>
    <ul>
      <li><tt><b>Yes</b>.</tt> The activity must attempt to initiate the correlation set.</li>
      <li><tt><b>Join</b></tt>. The activity must attempt to initiate the correlation set if the correlation set is not yet initiated.</li>
      <li><tt><b>No.</b></tt> The activity must not attempt to initiate the correlation set. This is the default option. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Optional) Add more correlation sets as needed and click
    OK.  </li>
</ol>
