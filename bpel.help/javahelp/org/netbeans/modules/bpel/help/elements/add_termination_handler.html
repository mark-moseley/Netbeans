<h2>BPEL Designer: Adding Termination Handlers </h2>

<p>The termination handler is used to control the termination of a scope. The termination of a scope happens if a scope or process enclosing it has faulted. </p>
<p>When a fault is thrown inside a scope or process, a fault handler associated with the scope or process should be run, but before that all the running activities inside the faulted  scope or process should be terminated. If a faulted scope or process has any enclosed scopes, they also should be terminated. Terminating a scope means terminating activities inside it and executing the termination handler associated with the scope.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">Note that the completion condition in </span>For Each element <span lang="EN"> may also  trigger termination of enclosed scopes. </span></p>
<p>The termination handler is a container for the activities that will be performed in case a scope is terminated. You can add one termination handler for a  scope.</p>
<p><b>To add a Termination Handler  to Scope or Process elements:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Design view right-click the Scope element  and choose Add &gt;  Termination Handler.<br>
  An empty container element appears. </li>
  <li>From the Palette, drag one or several activities that will be  executed and place them inside the Termination Handler container. Configure the properties of each activity. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
