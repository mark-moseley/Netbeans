<h2>BPEL Designer: Documentation and Report Generation </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The BPEL Designer has a feature that allows to create comments (documentation) attached to the elements of the BPEL Process. This documentation will be included in the source code of the BPEL process and later can be extracted and included in a report.

<h3>To create documentation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do one of the following:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Select an element on the diagram or in the Navigator window. </li>
  <li>In  the Properties window find  the Documentation field and type there anything you consider useful. </li>
  <li>Click on a small book icon near the selected element. A bubble will appear. Here you can write documentation for the element.</li>
  </ul>
The text will be included in the source code in the source code between tags 
<documentation></documentation> and placed after the opening tag of the appropriate element. 

<h3>To read documentation:</h3>
<p>A small  book icon near the element that is not selected indicates that the element has documentation . If you point at this icon with the cursor, a tool tip with the text written for the element will pop up. 
You can also see element's documentation in Documentation field of the Properties window.
<br>
To get all the documentation of the process as a separate file you can generate a report. </p>
<h3>Report Generation</h3>
<p>Report Generation feature of the BPEL Designer enables to generate a .pdf document describing the BPEL Process.</p>
<p><b>To generate a report:</b></p>
<p> On the BPEL diagram toolbar press the Generate Report button.</p>
In the Projects window among the Process files of the BPEL module a pdf file will appear. The report in pdf format contains the name of the process, the diagram, information about imported documents, information about partner links, a list of all variables defined in the process and information about process elements. If the elements have documentation written for them, it will be included in the report.
</p>
<p>You can customise the report using Customise Report button on the diagram toolbar. This button provides two options: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Check Generate Verbose report check-box if you want to get a detailed report (elements' properties will be included in the report) </li>
  <li> Check Include only elements with documentation check-box if you want only elements with documentation to be included in the report </li>
</ul>
