<h2>BPEL Designer: Documentation</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The BPEL Designer has a feature that allows to create comments (documentation) attached to the elements of the BPEL Process. This documentation will be included in the source code of the BPEL process and later can be extracted and included in a report.

<h3>To create documentation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do one of the following:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>In Documentation field of the Properties window for the selected element type anything you consider useful.</li>
  <li>Click on a small book icon near the selected element. A bubble will appear. Here you can write documentation for the element.</li>
  </ul>
The text will be included in the source code in the source code between tags <documentation></documentation> and placed after the opening tag of the appropriate element. 

<h3>To read documentation:</h3>
<p>A small  book icon near the element that is not selected indicates that the element has documentation . If you point at this icon with the cursor, a tool tip with the text written for the element will pop up. 
You can also see element's documentation in Documentation field of the Properties window.
<br>
To get all the documentation of the process as a separate file you can <a href="../design/report_gen.html" title="Report Generation">generate a report</a>.</p>
