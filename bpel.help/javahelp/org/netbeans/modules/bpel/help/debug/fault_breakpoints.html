<p>Fault breakpoints are special breakpoints used to monitor the state of variables before a fault is thrown. You can use this type of breakpoint to better understand the reasons for a fault by evaluating the BPEL process data before it runs into a fault state.</p>
<p><b>To set a fault breakpoint in BPEL:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the IDE, open the BPEL file in the Design view.</li>
<li>Select any element on the diagram and choose Run &gt; New Breakpoint.</li>
<li>In the New Breakpoint dialog box, select BPEL from the Debugger drop-down list.<br>
Note that the Breakpoint Type is automatically set to <tt>Fault</tt>. </li>
<li>Review the values in the  Process Target Namespace and Process Name fields. The IDE populates these fields automatically.</li>
<li>Note that the All Faults for the Given Process checkbox is selected by default. You can do one of the following: </li>
<ul>
  <li>Leave this checkbox selected to have the process suspend at the first fault that occurs in the process. </li>
  <li>Clear this checkbox and specify the namespace and name of a particular fault to set a fault breakpoint only for the specified fault. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Click OK. <br>
  Open the Breakpoints window to view the fault breakpoint you have just set. Note that fault breakpoints are not shown anywhere on the diagram or in the Navigator window. </li>
</ol>

<p>When you run a test case, the process will be suspended when it runs into a fault.  In the <a href="debug_windows_variables.html">BPEL Variables</a> window, you can view the values of the variables before the fault has been thrown.</p>
<p><b>To remove a fault breakpoint from the BPEL process:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Breakpoints window by choosing Window &gt; Debugging &gt; BPEL &gt; Breakpoints.</li>
  <li>Right-click the fault breakpoint you want to remove and choose Delete. <br>
    Note that choosing Delete All from the pop-up menu removes all breakpoints currently set in the IDE. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>To disable a fault breakpoint:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Breakpoints  window, clear the Enabled checkbox for the fault breakpoint you want to disable. <br>
    This disables the breakpoint but does not remove it completely.  </li>
</ul>
