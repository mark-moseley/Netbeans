<h2>BPEL Debugger: BPEL Process Instances Window </h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<!--Clarify about session names and the number of BPEL debugger sessions -->
<p>The BPEL Process Instances window lists all BPEL processes deployed to the BPEL Service Engine and their currently running instances. 
For each process instance correlation sets and Faults are listed as subnodes. </p>
<p>If the current session is not a BPEL Debugger session, this window is empty. The BPEL Process Instances window is populated when a debugging session starts  on the BPEL Service Engine, or when the current session is a BPEL Debugger session. </p>
<p>The  information displayed for each process instance includes the instance name, unique instance ID, and its state. Process instances can exist in one of the  following states: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Running.</b> The instance is  currently being executed on the BPEL Service Engine.</li>
  <li><b>Suspended.</b> The instance has been suspended for some reason. For example, the process instance has reached a breakpoint. </li>
  <li><b>Unknown.</b> The status of the instance is unknown.  </li>
</ul>
<p>A process instance that is current is shown in bold. A process instance becomes current when it reaches a breakpoint or when you manually make it current. </p>
<p><b>To make a process instance current, do one of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click the process instance.</li>
  <li>Right-click the process instance and choose Make Current from the pop-up menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To terminate a process instance:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click  the process instance and  select Terminate from the pop-up menu.<br>
    The process instance is terminated and removed from the list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Correlation Sets and Faults information </h3>
<p>For the Correlation Sets   node the information comes out during the process execution. </p>
<p>For each process instance correlation set, a list of  properties it includes is shown. For the properties, type and value information is displayed. Find more information on Correlation sets, properties, and property aliases here: <a href="../design/about_correlation_and_wizard.html">Understanding Correlation</a>. </p>
<p>The Faults node is also populated during the process execution. As a fault is thrown in the process, a subnode with the fault name appears. Fault data are provided if available. </p>
