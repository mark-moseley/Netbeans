<h2>	Using Breakpoints to Debug BPEL Processes</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<!-- -->
<p>Breakpoints are used to instruct the BPEL Debugger to stop execution at the specified place of a BPEL process. When a BPEL process instance reaches a breakpoint, it becomes suspended and you can step into the code, change the current process instance in the <a href="debug_windows_process.html">BPEL Process Instances</a> window, track the execution of the process instance in the <a href="debug_windows_execution.html">BPEL Process Execution</a> window and in the Design view, examine the values of variables in the <a href="debug_windows_variables.html">Local Variables</a> window, view the process partner links in the <a href="debug_windows_partner_links.html">Partner Links</a> window and view the values of XPath expressions in the <a href="watches.html">Watches</a> window.</p>
<p>You can also use fault breakpoints to check the values of variables before a fault is thrown. For more information, see <a href="fault_breakpoints.html" title="Using Fault Breakpoints in the BPEL Debugger">Using Fault Breakpoints in the BPEL Debugger</a>. </p>
<p>To view and organize the breakpoints currently set in the IDE, open the Breakpoints window by choosing Windows &gt; Debugging &gt; Breakpoints (Alt-Shift-5). For each breakpoint, you can see the name of the  file and the line where this breakpoint is located. In the Breakpoints window you can enable and disable breakpoints by checking or removing the checkbox in the Enabled column. </p>
<p><b>To set a breakpoint in a BPEL process:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the IDE, open the BPEL file in either the Source or Design view.</li>
<li>Do one of the following: </li>
<ul>
<li>In the Source view, click the left margin of the row where you want to place a breakpoint. </li>
<li>In the Design view, right-click an element where you want to place a breakpoint and choose Toggle Breakpoint (Ctrl-F8).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Design view, breakpoints are displayed as small red squares on top of specific elements. In the Source view, breakpoints are shown as red squares on the left margins of code lines. </p>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
<li>Alternatively, you can set and remove breakpoints in the <a href="../windows_editors/nav_bpelview.html">BPEL Logical view</a> of the Navigator window by choosing Toggle Breakpoint from the pop-up menu. In the Navigator window breakpoints are shown as small red squares attached to elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the project has reached the breakpoint it is suspended. You can manage the subsequent execution using the commands available in the Run menu or as buttons on the toolbar.</p>
<p><b><a name="stepping"></a>Within the debugging session the following commands are available:</b></p>
<p>To be able to use these commands you have to start the debugging session and to run a test case. </p>
<ul><ul>
    <li><strong>Pause.</strong> Once the user activates this action, the process will continue till it  reaches the first element on which it can stop. If  there is no current process instance, the debugger will wait for the  first execution event from any process instance.</li>
    <li><b>Continue (F5).</b> Once the process has reached the breakpoint or is paused you can choose Continue. This action causes the current process instance to run until 
      it encounters the next breakpoint or until the instance completes. The state of the instance changes to Running. </li>
    <li><b>Step Into (F7).</b> Steps to the next BPEL activity. As you step, the current line indicator advances, the current position is highlighted on the diagram, and the contents of 
      the BPEL Debugger windows  change accordingly. If the current activity has any enclosed elements, the process will step to the first enclosed element. Sometimes it is not visible on the diagram but is reflected in the BPEL Process Execution window. For example, if an Assign activity has &lt;copy&gt; element inside it, from the Assign the process will step to Copy. </li>
    <li><strong>Step Over (F8).</strong> Steps to the next BPEL activity of the same level as the current activity. If the current activity has any enclosed elements, they all are executed without suspension. </li>
    <li><strong>Step Out (Ctrl-F7). </strong>Steps to the next higher level activity of the process. For example, an Assign activity has several Copy elements inside. If one of the Copy elements is the current activity, performing Step Out will move you to the next activity of the Assign level and you will not have to step through all the Copy elements. </li>
    <li><b>Run to Cursor (F4)</b>. Runs the BPEL process to the position selected in the Navigator window (BPEL Logical View), on the diagram (in the Design view) or to the cursor location in the Source view. When the location of the cursor is reached, the process instance becomes suspended. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><b>To remove a breakpoint from the BPEL process, do one of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Source view, click the left margin of the line that contains the breakpoint.  </li>
  <li>In the Breakpoints window, right-click the breakpoint you want to remove and choose Delete. Choosing Delete All from the pop-up menu removes all breakpoints currently set in the IDE.</li>
  <li>In the Design view, right-click the element that has a red breakpoint mark and choose Toggle Breakpoint. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>To disable a breakpoint, do one of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>On the diagram, click on the small red square indicating the breakpoint. This disables the breakpoint but does not remove it completely.  </li>
  <li>In the Breakpoints  window, clear the Enabled checkbox for the breakpoint you want to disable. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Group operations over  breakpoints:</b></p>
<p>The toolbar contains three buttons for group operations over the process breakpoints. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enable Breakpoints for Selected Element.</strong> Enables all the breakpoints for the selected element and it's enclosed elements. </li>
  <li><strong>Disable Breakpoints for Selected Element.</strong> Disables all the breakpoints for the selected element and it's enclosed elements. </li>
  <li><strong>Delete Breakpoints for Selected Element.</strong> Deletes all the breakpoints for the selected element and it's enclosed elements. 
    <p>If no element is selected on the diagram, the Process element is considered selected for the operations. </p></li>
