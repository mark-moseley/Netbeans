<h2>	Using Breakpoints to Debug BPEL Processes</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<!-- -->
<p>Breakpoints are used to instruct the BPEL Debugger to stop execution at the specified place of a BPEL process. When a BPEL process instance reaches a breakpoint, it becomes suspended and you can step into the code, change the current process instance in the <a href="debug_windows_process.html">BPEL Process Instances</a> window, track the execution of the process instance in the <a href="debug_windows_execution.html">BPEL Process Execution</a> window and in the Design view, examine the values of variables in the <a href="debug_windows_variables.html">BPEL Variables</a> window, and view the values of XPath expressions in the <a href="watches.html">Watches</a> window.</p>
<p>You can also use fault breakpoints to check the values of variables before a fault is thrown. For more information, see <a href="fault_breakpoints.html" title="Using Fault Breakpoints in the BPEL Debugger">Using Fault Breakpoints in the BPEL Debugger</a>. </p>
<p>To view and organize the breakpoints currently set in the IDE, open the Breakpoints window by choosing Windows &gt; Debugging &gt; BPEL &gt; Breakpoints (Alt-Shift-5). For each breakpoint, you can see the name of the  file and the line where this breakpoint is located. </p>
<p><b>To set a breakpoint in a BPEL process:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>In the IDE, open the BPEL file in either the Source or Design view.</li>
<li>Do one of the following: </li>
<ul>
<li>In the Source view, click the left margin of the line where you want to place a breakpoint. </li>
<li>In the Design view, right-click an element where you want to place a breakpoint and choose Toggle Breakpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Design view, breakpoints are displayed as small red squares on top of specific elements. In the Source view, breakpoints are shown as red squares on the left margins of code lines.</p>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
<li>Alternatively, you can set and remove breakpoints in the <a href="../windows_editors/nav_bpelview.html">BPEL Logical view</a> of the Navigator window by choosing Toggle Breakpoint from the pop-up menu. </li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="stepping"></a>To debug a process instance that has reached a breakpoint</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Once the execution of your code is suspended, choose the following commands from the Run menu or on the toolbar: </li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Continue (Ctrl-F5).</b> Causes the current process instance to run until 
      it encounters the next breakpoint or until the instance completes. The state of the instance changes to Running. </li>
    <li><b>Step Into (F7).</b> Steps to the next BPEL activity. As you step, the current line indicator advances, the current position is highlighted on the diagram, and the contents of 
      the BPEL Debugger windows  change accordingly. The step is 
      supported only at the granularity of an &quot;activity&quot; in BPEL language terms, not at a finer 
      granularity. </li>
    <li><b>Run to Cursor (F4)</b>. Runs the BPEL process to the position selected in the Navigator window (BPEL Logical View), on the diagram (in the Design view) or to the cursor location in the Source view. When the location of the cursor is reached, the process instance becomes suspended. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><b>To remove a breakpoint from the BPEL process, do one of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Source view, click the left margin of the line that contains the breakpoint.  </li>
  <li>In the Breakpoints window, right-click the breakpoint you want to remove and choose Delete. Choosing Delete All from the pop-up menu removes all breakpoints currently set in the IDE.</li>
  <li>In the Design view, right-click the element that has a red breakpoint mark and choose Toggle Breakpoint. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>To disable a breakpoint:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Breakpoints  window, clear the Enabled checkbox for the breakpoint you want to disable. <br>
    This disables the breakpoint but does not remove it completely.  </li>
</ul>
