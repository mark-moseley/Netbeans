          Those processors that wish to be informed about every command line
          processing, can register themselves as providers of 
          <a href="@TOP@/org/netbeans/spi/sendopts/Option.html#always()">always</a>
          option. This one is automatically present in each successfully parsed
          command line.

          After the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=57611">review from others</a>
          it has been decided to de-generify the interfaces. As a result
          of this complete rewrite, the API clients need to be fully 
          rewritten as most of the method signatures changed.

          Use <code>Option.shortDescription</code> to associate a one-liner
          text with an option. This description will be printed when showing
          usage for the command line.

      <description>
          There is a new factory method in <code>CommandException</code>
          that can influence the localized message which is then printed
          to the user as a description of the error.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
<p>The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.</p>
