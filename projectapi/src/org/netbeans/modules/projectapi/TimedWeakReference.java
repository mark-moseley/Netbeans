/**
 * A weak reference which is held strongly for a while after last access.
 * Lifecycle:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Created. Referent held strongly. A task is scheduled into the request
 *     processor for some time in the future (currently 15 seconds).</li>
 * <li>Expired. After the timeout, the reference switches to a normal weak
 *     reference.</li>
 * <li>Touched. If the value is accessed before it is garbage collected,
 *     whether the reference is expired or not, the reference is "touched".
 *     This means that the referent is again held strongly and the timeout
 *     is started from scratch.</li>
 * <li>Dead. If after expiry there is no access before the next full GC cycle,
 *     the GC algorithm may reclaim the reference. In this case the reference
 *     of course dies.</li>
