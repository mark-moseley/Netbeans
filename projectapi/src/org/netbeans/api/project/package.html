General API for finding and manipulating all kinds of projects.

<p>A {@link org.netbeans.api.project.Project} is a representation of a folder
which may contain various kinds of development artifacts and/or metadata.
Projects can be loaded, saved, etc. using
{@link org.netbeans.api.project.ProjectManager}.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.api.project.FileOwnerQuery} is a simple way to associate
a file or folder with a project. Typically, all files beneath a project's folder are
