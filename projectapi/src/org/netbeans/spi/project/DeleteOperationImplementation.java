 * Project Delete Operation. Allows to gather information necessary for project
 * delete and also provides callbacks to the project type to handle special
 * checkpoints during the delete.
 *
 * An implementation of this interface may be registered in the project's lookup to support
 * delete operation in the following cases:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The project type wants to use
 * <a href="@org-netbeans-modules-projectuiapi@/org/netbeans/spi/project/ui/support/DefaultProjectOperations.html"><code>DefaultProjectOperations</code></a>
 *         to perform the delete operation.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>If this project may be part of of a compound project (like EJB project is a part of a J2EE project),
 *        and the compound project wants to delete all the sub-projects.
 *    </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The project type is not required to put an implementation of this interface into the project's
 * lookup if the above two cases should not be supported.
