/**
 * Project Copy Operation. Allows to gather information necessary for project
 * copy and also provides callbacks to the project type to handle special
 * checkpoints during the copy process.
 *
 * An implementation of this interface may be registered in the project's lookup to support
 * copy operation in the following cases:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The project type wants to use the {@link org.netbeans.spi.project.ui.support DefaultProjectOperationsImplementation}
 *         to perform the copy operation.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>If this project may be part of of a compound project (like EJB project is a part of a J2EE project),
 *        and the compound project wants to copy all the sub-projects.
 *    </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The project type is not required to put an implementation of this interface into the project's
 * lookup if the above two cases should not be supported.
