 * Provider of the instance of the given class.

 * The provider gets a list of files which it transfers
 * into one instance of the class for which it's declared.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example there can be an instance provider
 * of actions for the editor popup. The file object names
 * of the actions declared in the layer can be of two forms:<ul>
 *   <li><i>MyAction.instance</i> are actions instances declaration files</li>.
 *   <li><i>reformat-code</i> are editor actions names</li>.
 * </ul>
 * <br/>
 * The instance provider translates all the file objects to actions
 * which it returns as a collection in some sort of collection-like class
 * e.g.<pre>
 * interface PopupActions {
 *
 *     List&lt;Action> getActions();
 *
 * }</pre>
