/**
 *  Provides an initialization of MimeLookup on either global or mime-type
 *  specific level.
 *  <br>
 *  The implementations of this class should be registed to default lookup by
 *  <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/lookup/index.html"> META-INF/services registration</a>.
 *  <br>
 *  Such registered instance serves as a global level initializer
 *  which can further be asked for children by {@link #child(String)}
 *  which will lead to forming of a tree initializers hierarchy.
 *  <br>
 *  The contents provided by {@link #lookup()} of the global-level initializer
 *  (the one registered in the layer) will automatically appear
 *  in all the results returned by <code>MimeLookup</code> for any particular mime type.
 *  <br>
 *  Once someone asks for a <code>MimeLookup</code> for a specific mime-type
 *  by using {@link org.netbeans.api.editor.mimelookup.MimeLookup#getMimeLookup(String)}
 *  the global level initializer will be asked for {@link #child(String)}
 *  and the {@link #lookup()} on the returned children
 *  will define the result data (together with the global-level initializer's lookup).
 *  <br>
 *  This process can be arbitrarily nested for embedded mime-types.
 *  
 * <p> 
 *  An example implementation of MimeLookupInitializer
 *  that works over xml layer file system can be found at mime lookup module
 *  implementation <a href="http://editor.netbeans.org/source/browse/editor/mimelookup/src/org/netbeans/modules/editor/mimelookup/Attic/LayerMimeLookupImplementation.java">LayerMimeLookupInitializer</a>
