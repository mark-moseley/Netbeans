<h2>About Chat</h2>
<p>Once you are participating in a conversation, you have the ability to use the Chat channel to easily communicate with colleagues. The Chat channel is located at the bottom of the conversation window and has two main elements: </p>
<ol>
<li>The <b>chat transcript pane</b> shows the messages that have been sent within the conversation. All chat messages, including yours, will be displayed in the chat transcript.</li> 
<li>The <b>chat input pane</b> allows you to enter a message and then send it to the other participants in the conversation.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>You can enter messages in the the chat input pane in several formats:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Plain text.</b> Messages are sent as formatted text. This format is useful for sending general messages as well as stack traces or other formatted text content.</li> 
<li><b>Java.</b> Messages are sent as formatted and syntax-colored Java source code. This format is useful for quick discussions or reviews of Java source.</li> 
<li><b>HTML.</b> Messages are sent as HTML source. This format allows you to enter HTML and display it to the other participants as formatted and syntax-colored HTML.</li> 
<li><b>XML.</b> Messages are sent as XML source. This format allows you to enter XML and display it to the other participants as formatted and syntax-colored XML.</li> 
</ul> 
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="images/tip.gif" alt="note">&nbsp;</td>
<td>If you copy Java source code, HTML source, or XML source from elsewhere within the IDE (or potentially other applications) and then paste it into the chat input pane, the message format automatically changes to the associated format. You can change the message format manually if you prefer to send the message in a different format than the one automatically selected for you.</td>
