        <p>
          <code>SystemAction putValue("noIconInMenu", Boolean.TRUE)</code> influences the display of the action
          in the main menu, the item will have no icon there. Works for Actions that don't define custom MenuPresenter.
          This property is considered temporary, applications building on top of the platform that 
          don't want this functionality, have to patch the actions' code.

     <description>
     Support for asynchronous execution of actions has been re-added. Right now
     all <code>CallableSystemAction</code> that return <code>true</code>
     from their <code>asynchronous</code> method are executed outside of AWT thread.
     However as most actions shall be executed synchronously, it is still required
     for a subclass of <code>CallableSystemAction</code> to override the method
     with own implementation otherwise a warning is printed.
     <p>
     There is a special contract to allow synchronous actions to be executed 
     asynchronously, by using special <a href="arch/openide-actions.html#api-waitFinished" shape="rect">waitFinished</a>
     as action command.

      <summary>Lightweight HTML rendering methods</summary>
      <version major="4" minor="32"/>

      <description>
      A lightweight HTML renderer which can render a limited subset of
      HTML has been added to the APIs, and will be used in Explorer.
      Nodes wishing to provide text rendered in HTML may do so by
      returning subset-compliant HTML formatted text from the new
      method <code>getHtmlDisplayName</code>.  An interface,
      <code>HTMLStatus</code> has been created which extends 
      <code>FileSystem.Status</code>, has been created, which allows
      filesystems to supply HTML formatted status information, by
      implementing it on their <code>FileSystem.Status</code> implementation.
      Filesystems which delegate to other filesystems my implement 
      FileSystem.HtmlStatus and simply return null for filesystems which
      do not support it.
      If one is present, DataNode will use it to supply HTML formatted
      text to Explorer.  The renderer itself can be found in 
      org.openide.awt.HtmlRenderer.

        <summary>Support for pressed, disabled and rollover icons added to SystemAction and Actions</summary>
        <version major="4" minor="22"/>

        <description>
            Method SystemAction.getValue() was modified to support one additional special parameter: "iconBase".
            If a value with this key is required the method calls into SystemAction.iconResource. Class
            org.openide.awt.Actions uses value of "iconBase" to fetch the icons. The "iconBase" parameter is
            used not only when connecting SystemAction but for all javax.swing.Action instances. The value of
            "iconBase" is a path to the icon resources without the trailing .gif. The code in Actions adds
            .gif, _pressed.gif, _disabled.gif and _rollover.gif suffices to the iconBase.

            <p>
            According to changes in action system (see the change 3.29),
            also the method <code>TopComponent.getSystemActions()</code> 
            is replaced by <code>TopComponent.getActions()</code> method.

            Introduction of new action system, which generally means
            move from usage of <code>SystemAction</code> to <code>Action</code> instances.
            Look at <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/proposals/actions/index.html" shape="rect">
            general proposal</a>. That document also focuses on declarative actions
            usage which is not subject of current change, it will be part of later changes.
            </p>
<p>
            Current change is described by <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/proposals/actions/impl.html" shape="rect">
            description of already implemented changes</a> which also summarizes
            <a href="http://openide.netbeans.org/proposals/actions/impl.html#summaryAPI" shape="rect">
            these API changes</a>.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
<p>The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>release41</code> branch was made on Apr 03 '05 for use in the NetBeans 4.1 release.
Specification versions: 6.0 begins after this point.</li>
<li>The <code>release40</code> branch was made on Nov 01 '04 for use in the NetBeans 4.0 release.
Specification versions: 5.0 begins after this point.</li>
