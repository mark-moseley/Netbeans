<h2>About the CASA Editor</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Composite Application Service Assembly (CASA) editor provides a visual interface to a composite application that allows you to interactively modify the applications's deployment configuration. You can also build the composite application from the CASA Editor.
</p>

<div class="comment"><div class="change-bar">
<p>The following paragraphs are too detailed for this online help topic. I'm including them here so we can discuss the terminology and concepts. However, it will be moved to another help topic that covers concepts.</p>

<p>
A composite application contains any combination of service engines, which provide services, and binding components, which act as proxies for external services. When you deploy a composite application you create a service assembly. The service assembly itself is made up of service units, each of which represents a service engine or binding component within the composite application. A composite application can also connect to <i>external services</i>, which are service units deployed by another composite application.
</p>
<p>
The visual representation of a composite application in the CASA Editor allows you to concentrate on the business logic of a composite application, independent of deployment details of the application's WSDL endpoints.  For example, you can develop BPEL projects using abstract WSDL that does not include concrete WSDL configurations for endpoints. You can then use the CASA Editor to later add deployment-specific information with respect to the WSDL endpoints.
</p>

<p>
The CASA Editor has two views, Design View and Source View. 
</p>
<p> In the Design View, the Palette window is visible. The Palette window allows 
  you to drag and drop WSDL bindings, external Service Units, and connections 
  to a composite application. This allows you to interactively specify WSDL Port 
  configurations and connections between components in the composite application. 
</p>
<p>
The Source View displays the <tt>.casa</tt> source file that defines the composite application. This file is read-only in this view. Because this file is generated by the CASA Editor, you should not edit this file.
</p>
<p>Typical operations you perform in the CASA Editor include:</p>
