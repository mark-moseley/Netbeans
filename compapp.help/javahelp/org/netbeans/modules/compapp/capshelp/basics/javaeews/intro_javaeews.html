<h2>About JBI and Java EE Web Services</h2>
<p>To make Java EE web services work with JBI runtime components, it is necessary 
    to deploy Java EE web services as part of a composite application. NetBeans 
    5.5.1 includes additional server resource support for Java EE Applications 
    packaged inside composite applications. Users can specify whether to deploy 
    Java EE projects or components through the service assembly, or to deploy 
    independently and optimize the intra Java virtual machine communication. </p>
  <p>This addresses the issue of Java EE applications packaged inside composite 
    applications that have resource dependencies, such as connection pools or 
    JMS destinations, that are created before deployment. The addition of server 
    resource support for Java EE applications makes it easier for users to resolve 
    resource dependencies by combining all the resource dependencies of a Java 
    EE application into a single <tt>sun-resources.xml</tt> before packaging into 
    a <tt>.jar</tt> or <tt>.war</tt> file. </p>
  <h3>How it is Done</h3>
  <p>Resource creation can be facilitated through JMS by NetBeans. It can also 
    be delegated to the application server by including a special EAR file called 
    <tt>sun-resources.xml</tt> that includes descriptions of all the resources 
    that need to be created during deployment. These sun-resrouces.xml files are 
    the primary means of storing resource configuration information and resources 
    editing in the application server environment. </p>
  
<p><b>Complete the following steps prior to administering server resources 
  for Java EE applications:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li> Creating a new Web Application or EJB Module (which includes web services 
    implementation or web service usage)</li>
  <li> Coding the necessary @Resource annotations </li>
  <li> Creating a composite application. </li>
  <li> Adding a JBI Module</li>
</ol>
  <p>Once these steps are completed, it is then possible to manage the server 
    resources directly through the JBI Module.<br>
