<h2>Creating Application Variables for WSDL Attributes</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The binding component Application Variables property allows you to define a 
  list of name:value pairs for a given stated type. The application variable name 
  can be used as a token for a WSDL extensibility element attribute in a corresponding 
  binding. For example, if you were defining an application variable for the <tt>hostname</tt> 
  as FOO, then the WSDL attribute would be <tt>${FOO}</tt>. In the Application 
  Variables property you would enter a String value of <tt>FOO</tt> for the name, 
  and the desired attribute as the value. When you deploy an application that 
  uses application variables, any variable that is referenced in the application's 
  WSDL is loaded automatically. </p>
<p>The Application Variables configuration property offers four variable types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>String</strong>: specifies a string value, such as a path or directory.</li>
  <li><strong>Number</strong>: specifies a number value.</li>
  <li><strong>Boolean</strong>: specifies a Boolean value. The VALUE field provides 
    a checkbox (checked = true).</li>
  <li><strong>Password</strong>: specifies a password value. The password is masked 
    and displays only asterisks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using Application Variables for password protection</strong></p>
<p>To protect passwords that would otherwise appear as clear text in your WSDL 
  file, you can enter a Password application variable as a token. In the following 
  example, a password application variable is created that uses the name SECRET 
  and the password PROTECT.</p>
  
<ol>
  <li>From the Binding Components directory, under Servers &gt; GlassFish V2 &gt; 
    JBI in the Servers window, select the sun-http-binding. The sun-http-binding 
    Properties appear in the Properties window.</li>
  <li>Click-on the Application Variables property ellipsis (...) button. The Application 
    Variables editor appears.</li>
  <li>Click Add, select Password as your variable type, and click OK. A new row 
    is added to the Application Variables editor.</li>
  <li>Enter SECRET as the Name, and enter PROTECT as the Value. Because this is 
    a password type, the characters of your password are displayed as asterisks.</li>
  <li>Use the application variable name ${SECRET} as your WSDL password attribute, 
    using the dollar sign and curley braces as shown.</li>
</ol>
<p>Variables also allow greater flexibility for your WSDL files. For example, 
  you can use the same WSDL for different operating systems by using application 
  variables to specify system specific information. These values can then be changed 
  from the binding component runtime properties as needed, for any specific system.</p>
