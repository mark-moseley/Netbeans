<h2>JBI Nodes: Runtime Functionality</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can perform the following runtime actions on items contained in the subfolders of the JBI node:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_ServiceEngines.html" title="Service Engines Node (Under Runtime/Server/JBI)">Service 
    Engines</a> node, you can start, stop, shutdown, uninstall, upgrade, undeploy, 
    refresh, show endpoint statistics, or access properties for the selected service 
    engine. </li>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_BindingComponents.html" title="Binding Components Node (Under Runtime/Server/JBI)">Binding 
    Components</a> node, you can start, stop, shutdown, uninstall, upgrade, undeploy, 
    refresh, show endpoint statistics, or access properties for the selected binding 
    component. </li>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_SharedLibraries.html" title="Shared Libraries Node (Under Runtime/Server/JBI)"> 
    Shared Libraries</a> node, you can uninstall or access properties for the 
    selected shared library. </li>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_ServiceAssemblies.html">Service 
    Assemblies</a> node, you can start, stop, shutdown, undeploy refresh, or access 
    properties for the selected service assembly. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can right-click the folder itself to install/deploy and start 
  a new component or to refresh the current list. Note that components can be 
  installed and deployed by tools other than the JBI node by such means as ant 
  tasks or the administrator console. Therefore, it is good practice to refresh 
  the component list immediately before you use a pop-up menu to take any action. 
</p>
<h3> Starting, Stopping, Shutting Down, Uninstalling/Undeploying, Upgrading, and 
  Refreshing </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Starting or stopping a component causes it to begin or end processing, such 
    as reading/transforming/writing data, or seeking/making/dropping connections. 
  </li>
  <li>Shutting down a component keeps it available to the application server, 
    but flags it as not currently processing.</li>
  <li>Uninstalling a component, or undeploying a service assembly, removes it 
    from the set of components that are available to the application server. </li>
  <li>Upgrading a component undeploys and uninstalls the current instance of component, 
    and installs and transfers your settings to a new instance of the component. 
  </li>
  <li>Refreshing a component updates the component with the latest settings and 
    information.</li>
</ul>
