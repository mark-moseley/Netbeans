<h2>JBI Nodes: Runtime Functionality</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can perform the following runtime actions on items contained in the subfolders of the JBI node:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_ServiceEngines.html" title="Service Engines Node (Under Services/Server/JBI)">Service 
    Engines</a> node, you can start, stop, shut down, or uninstall an existing 
    service engine. </li>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_BindingComponents.html" title="Binding Components Node (Under Services/Server/JBI)">Binding 
    Components</a> node, you can start, stop, shut down, or uninstall an existing 
    binding component. </li>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_SharedLibraries.html" title="Shared Libraries Node (Under Services/Server/JBI)"> Shared Libraries</a> node, you can uninstall an existing shared library. </li>
  <li>By right-clicking a component name under the <a href="caps_jbi_node_ServiceAssemblies.html">Service 
    Assemblies</a> node, you can start, stop, shut down, or undeploy an existing 
    service assembly. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can right-click the folder itself to install/deploy a new component or to 
  refresh the current list. 
  Note that components can be installed and deployed by tools other than the JBI node by such means as ant tasks or the administrator console. 
  Therefore, it is good practice to refresh the component list immediately before you use a   pop-up menu to take any action. </p>
<h3>
Starting, Stopping, Shutting Down, and Uninstalling/Undeploying
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Starting or stopping a component causes it to begin or end processing, such as 
    reading/transforming/writing data, or seeking/making/dropping connections. </li>
  <li>Shutting down a component keeps it available to application server while flagging 
    it as not currently processing. </li>
  <li>Uninstalling a component, or undeploying a service assembly, removes it 
    from the set of components that are available to the application server. </li>
</ul>
