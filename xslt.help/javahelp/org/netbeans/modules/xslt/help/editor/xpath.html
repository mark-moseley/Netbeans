             The Expression Builder is an editor that is used to build XPath expressions not covered by XPath functions included in the Palette or any other arbitrary XPath expression. Currently, relative location paths and location paths with predicates are not supported.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Expression Builder is invoked when you add an XPath Expression function from the Palette, or when you double-click the input field in the XPath Expression function box which is located on the Transformations pane.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Expression Builder consists of three panes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Schema</b>. This pane, located on the left side, shows the tree structure of the XML Schema underlying the incoming message.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Functions</b>. This pane, located on the right side, contains XPath functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Expression</b>. This pane, located at the bottom, is where the expression is built. Clicking the Check Syntax button, located on the Expression pane toolbar, checks the expression.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>To build an expression:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Drag the XPath Expression function from the Palette to the Transformations pane. The Expression Builder opens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click a node in the Schema pane or a function in the Functions pane. The corresponding code is added to the expression in the Expression pane. Clicking another node or function adds the corresponding code at the cursor in the expression.
            </li>
            <li>
                (Optional) Manually modify the expression in the Expression pane.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the Check Syntax button. Correct errors, if any.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click OK.
            </li>
