        <p>
             The XSL Transformation Editor is an editor for XSL stylesheets created within XSLT Module projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The XSL Transformation Editor consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>The Design view</b>. The Design view of the XSL Transformation Editor provides a framework enabling you to develop sophisticated XSL stylesheets in an intuitive, visual manner.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Source view</b>. The Source view of the XSL Transformation Editor enables you to edit the source code of the XSL stylesheet you are developing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The XSL Transformation Editor supports a full round-trip engineering cycle, which includes both forward and reverse engineering. The XSL Transformation Editor synchronizes the XSLT Design and Source views in the following way:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Changes you make in the Design view are reflected immediately in the corresponding source code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changes you make in the source code are reflected in the Design view when you switch to the Design view.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changes are synchronized when you click File &gt; Save (Ctrl-S) either in the XSLT Design or Source view.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The XSL Transformation Editor toolbar located in the upper part of the XSL Transformation Editor contains two buttons: Source and Design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Design view opens by default when you double-click an XSL stylesheet in an XSLT Module project.
        </p>
        <p>
            To switch to the Source view, click Source on the XSL Transformation Editor toolbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            To switch back to the Design view, click Design on the XSL Transformation Editor toolbar.
