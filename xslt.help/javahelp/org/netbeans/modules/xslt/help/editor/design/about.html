        <p>
             The Design view of the XSL Transformation Editor provides a framework that enables you to develop sophisticated XSL stylesheets in an intuitive, visual manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Design view includes three main components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>The Source tree pane</b>. The Source tree pane is located on the left side of the Design view and shows the tree of nodes corresponding to the XML Schema which is used as the basis for the incoming message.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Transformations pane</b>. The Transformations pane is located in the middle of the Design view and contains a canvas for creating mappings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Destination tree pane</b>. The Destination tree pane is located on the right side of the Design view. It shows the tree of nodes corresponding to the XSL stylesheet that is being created, the tree of nodes corresponding to the XML Schema which is used as the basis for the outgoing message, and any transformation rules that you add to the stylesheet.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Design view is the default view of the XSL Transformation Editor. To switch to the Source view, click the Source button on the XSL Transformation Editor toolbar. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Design view Palette, which contains a collections of XPath functions, opens whenever the Design View of the XSL Transformation Editor is active.
