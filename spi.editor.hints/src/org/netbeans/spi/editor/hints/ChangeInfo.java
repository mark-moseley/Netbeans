 * <p>
 * In other words, a change generated by a hint can generate things like
 * variable names;  ChangeInfo provides a list of generated code which the
 * user might want to modify/replace with their own text.  The start/end offsets
 * are offsets into the file in question, which determine selection start/end
 * in the editor.
 * <p>
 * This class provides for a list of changes, anticipating &quot;live template&quot;
 * support (where the user confirms each generated element).  Currently only
 * the first change provided is used.
