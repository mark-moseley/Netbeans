        <h2>Mercurial: Export Diff Dialog Box</h2>
        
        <p>The Mercurial Export Diff dialog box enables you to export all the diffs for
            modified files within a given changeset. You can also use the dialog to attach
            the diffs to an existing issue in your repository's issue tracker.</p>
        
        <p>You can access the Export Diff dialog by choosing Team &gt; (Mercurial &gt;) Export
            Diff from the main menu.</p>
            
        <p><strong>Choose from Revisions</strong>: Select a revision from the drop-down field.
            Revisions are displayed containing revision numbers and corresponding changeset IDs
            in parentheses. Revisions are listed according to date (i.e., the most current
            revision is displayed by default).</p>

        <p><strong>Details</strong>: The following read-only fields list information that will
            be associated with the exported diffs.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description</strong>: The description associated with the changeset.</li>
            <li><strong>Author</strong>: The author associated with the changeset.</li>
            <li><strong>Date</strong>: The date the changeset was created (i.e., pushed to the
                repository).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Specify whether you want to output the diffs to a file on your computer, or attach them
            to an existing issue. Select one of the two options:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Save as File</strong>: Specify the name and location of the output file that
                will be generated from performing the export. Click Browse to open an explorer allowing
                you to navigate to a specific location on your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Attach to Issue</strong>: To attach the diffs to an existing issue, you need
                to specify your repository's issue tracker and the issue ID. You can also indicate
                a description of the diff by typing a message in <strong>Patch Description</strong>.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Issue Tracker</strong>: Select the issue tracker for your project
                        from the drop-down list. The drop-down
                        provides you with a list of all issue trackers registered with the IDE. If
                        the issue tracker for your project is not registered, click the <strong>New</strong>
                        button to register the issue tracker.</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Specify the issue ID. You can do this by typing in
                        the ID, or part of the description.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
