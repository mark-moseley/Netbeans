        <h2>Mercurial: Status Window</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Mercurial Status window presents a real-time view of the changes made in 
            your local working copy for selected version-controlled directories. It opens by 
            default in the bottom panel of the IDE, listing added, deleted or modified files.</p>
            
        <p>To open the Status window, choose Window &gt; Versioning &gt; Mercurial from the 
            main menu. Alternately, you can select a versioned file or folder (e.g., from the
            Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and either choose Mercurial &gt; Status from
            the node's right-click menu, or choose Team &gt; Status from the main menu.</p>
        
        <p>By default, the Status window displays a list of all modified files within the selected 
            package or folder. The toolbar label includes the current revision of the working
            directory and the Mercurial ChangeSet ID. You can click the column headings above
            the listed files to sort the files by name, status or location.</p>
            
        <p>The Status window toolbar includes buttons that enable you to invoke the most common 
            Mercurial tasks on all files displayed in the list. The following table lists the Mercurial 
            commands available in the toolbar of the Status window:</p>
            
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <th>Icon</th>
                <th style="width:100px">Name</th>
                <th>Function</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center"><img src="images/refresh.png" alt="refresh status icon"></td>
                <td align="center"><strong>Refresh Status</strong></td>
                <td>Refreshes the status of the selected files. Files displayed 
                    in the Status window can be refreshed to reflect any changes that
                    may have been made externally.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center"><img src="images/diff.png" alt="diff all icon"></td>
                <td align="center"><strong>Diff All</strong></td>
                <td>Opens the Diff Viewer providing you with a side-by-side comparison of 
                    your local copies and the versions maintained in the repository.</td>
            </tr>     
            <tr>
                <td align="center"><img src="images/update.png" alt="update all icon"></td>
                <td align="center"><strong>Update All</strong></td>
                <td>Updates the working directory from the repository.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center"> </td>
                <td align="center"><strong>Update Target</strong></td>
                <td>Allows you to specify the revision to update the working directory to, when clicking on Update All.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center"><img src="images/commit.png" alt="commit all icon"></td>
                <td align="center"><strong>Commit All</strong></td>
                <td>Enables you to commit local changes to the repository.</td>
            </tr>            
        </table>
        
        <br>

            row that corresponds to a modified file, and choosing a command from the right-click menu.
            You can, for example, perform the following actions on a file:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open</strong>. Open the file in the Source Editor.</li>
            <li><strong>Diff</strong>. Launch the Diff Viewer for this file,

                to files in your local working copy. When you invoke the Revert Delete command, the specified
