	<h2>Mercurial: Diff Viewer</h2
        
	<p>The IDE's graphical Diff Viewer enables you to compare 
            revisions of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences 
            between the files being compared.</p>
            
	<p>You access the Diff Viewer in one of the following manners:</p> 
            
        <ul>
            <li>select a version-controlled file or folder (e.g. from the Projects, Files or 
                Favorites window) and choose either Mercurial &gt; Diff from the right-click menu or
                Versioning &gt; Diff from the main menu.</li>
            <li>select the Diff view from the <a href="mercurial-statuswindow.html">Status Window</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>The Diff Viewer tool bar provides you with the following functionality:</h4>

        <ul>                
            <li>Navigate among differences found in the compared files. Choose to view differences 
                as they appear from top to bottom by clicking the appropriate icon:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button">: Go to 
                        previous difference.</li>
                    <li><img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">: Go to next 
                        difference.</li>
                </ul></li>
        
            <li>Refresh the status of the diff (e.g. in the event that changes to your local
                working directory have been made externally), and update the status of the 
                repository versions of files listed in the diff:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/update.png" alt="update button">: Update the working directory from the repository.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Commit any changes contained in your local working directory:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/commit.png" alt="commit button">: Commit the selected 
                        item to the repository.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
                
        <h4>The Diff Viewer provides the following UI components:</h4>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
