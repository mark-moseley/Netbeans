<HTML><BODY>
Creates a resource bundle (.properties) file suitable for 
internationalizing applications by separating out all human-visible 
text strings from your code. Resource bundle files can also be used 
to collect other types of strings, such as properties for Ant scripts. 
The created resource bundle contains only one locale, but you can add 
additional locales from the created file's contextual menu. The bundle 
can be edited in a text file (property-file format) for a specific locale or in a table that displays
information for all locales.
