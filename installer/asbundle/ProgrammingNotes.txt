Prerequisites
   
 - InstallShield MultiPlatform 5 (SP3)
 - Apache Ant 1.6.1
 - JDK 1.4.2 (not JDK 1.5 which uses an incompatible classfile format)
 - external unzip utility on $PATH
 - Unix
 - Installers of AS 8.1 PE for all 5 supported platforms: Windows, Linux,
   Solaris Sparc, Solaris X86, Mac OS X (zip file containing installer).

To build from command line run ant as usual with

 -Dismp.home=<home dir of ISMP5>
 -Dnb.dir=../../nbbuild/netbeans
 -Dinstaller.basename=NetBeans-asbundle-20040622
 -Das.installer=/mnt/local/as.installer/sjsas_pe-8_1_2005Q1-linux.bin
 -Dstorage.builder=../../java/storagebuilder/dist/storagebuilder.jar
 -Dpreparse.files=../../java/storagebuilder/preparse-files.txt

Property storage.builder contains location of storage builder jar file.
 
Property preparse.files contains location of text file with list of classes to
be parsed by storage builder. Colon ':' is used as list separator.

Build targets for supported platforms are as follows: build-linux,
build-solaris-sparc, build-solaris-x86, build-windows, build-macosx.

As there is different command line option for every platform it must be run
separately for every platform.

The installers will be generated and placed in the directory 'dist'.
