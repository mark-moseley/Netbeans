Prerequisites
   
 - InstallShield Universal 11
 - Apache Ant 1.6.3
 - JDK 1.4.2_X (not JDK 1.5 which uses an incompatible classfile format)
 - external unzip utility on $PATH

Default target is 'build'.

Target 'build' builds installers for 4 supported platforms with language 
support for English (en).

Target 'build-ml' builds installers for 4 supported platforms with language
support for English (an), Japanese (ja) and Simplified Chinese (zh).
Suffix '-ml' is added to installer.basename.

Supported platforms are:
1.Linux (including 64bit Linux + 64bit JDK on AMD). Suffix '-linux' is added
to installer.basename.
2.Solaris Sparc. Suffix '-solsparc' is added.
3.Solaris X86. Suffix '-solx86' is added.
4.Windows. Suffix '-win' is added.

To build from command line run ant as usual with

 -Dismp.home=<home dir of ISMP5>
 -Dnb.dir=../../nbbuild/netbeans
 -Dinstaller.basename=NetBeans-dev-20040622
 -Dstorage.builder=../../java/storagebuilder/dist/storagebuilder.jar
 -Dpreparse.files=../../java/storagebuilder/preparse-files.txt

Property storage.builder contains location of storage builder jar file.
Storage builder project is located at /cvs/java/storagebuilder. It must be
built separately as usual using command 'ant' in its project dir. After
storagebuilder is built storagebuilder.jar is created in directory
/cvs/java/storagebuilder/dist. To build storage builder IDE must be built
first as it uses some jars from IDE.

Property preparse.files contains location of text file with list of classes to
be parsed by storage builder. Colon ':' is used as list separator. File is
located at /cvs/java/storagebuilder/preparse-files.txt.

The installers will be generated to 'dist' directory.
