Prerequisites
   
 - InstallShield Universal 11
 - Apache Ant 1.6.5
 - JDK 1.5.0_06
 - external unzip utility on $PATH
 - Linux/Solaris

To build from command line run ant as usual with

 -Dismp.home=<home dir of ISMP5>
 -Dcluster.dir=/path/to/sonyerisccon-cdc (something like f4j_me/sandbox/p990/build/cluster)
 -Dinstaller.basename=NetBeansSonyEricssonCDC-dev-20060107

The installers will be generated and placed in the dist/ subdir

As there is different command line option for every platform it must be run
separately for every platform.

Build targets to build English (en) installers for supported platforms are
as follows:
build-linux - Linux - suffix '-linux' is appended to installer.basename
build-windows - Windows - suffix '-win'
                                                                                                             
Build targets for ML installers (Language support for Japanese (ja) and
Simplified Chinese (zh) is added to English support ie. en,ja,zh support is
present):
build-linux-ml - Linux - suffix '-linux-ml' is appended to installer.basename
build-windows-ml - Windows - suffix '-win-ml'

For linux also jar installer is built in addition to native installer. jar
installer is used for i18n testing and debuging.
