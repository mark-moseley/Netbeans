product.display.name=Web Services for Remote Portlets {display-version}
product.description=Web Services for Remote Portlets {display-version} is a standard that provides web service-based access capability to portlets and enables interoperability among different portal server solutions. WSRP is a presentation-oriented web service. Unlike common web services that carry only the raw data as the result of a request, a WSRP response carries fully rendered markup to be included within a portal page.
