It is not necessary to build this library separately as projects requiring
this library will build it when required. Value of property ismp.home is
passed from caller script.

To build from command line run ant with target jar as usual with

 -Dismp.home=<home dir of ISU11>

eg. ant -Dismp.home=/mnt/local/is11 jar

The lib.jar will be generated and placed in the dist/ subdir
