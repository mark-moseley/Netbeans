Prerequisites
   
 - InstallShield MultiPlatform 5 (SP3)
 - Apache Ant 1.6.2
 - JDK 1.4.2 (not JDK 1.5 which uses an incompatible classfile format)
 - external unzip utility on $PATH
 - Unix
 - Profiler cluster for all 4 supported platforms - content of profiler1
   directory for Windows, Linux, Solaris Sparc, Solaris X86.

To build from command line run ant as usual with

 -Dismp.home=<home dir of ISMP5>
 -Dcluster.dir=i$HOME/profiler/linux
 -Dinstaller.basename=Profiler-20040622

Build targets to build English (en) installers for supported platforms are
as follows:
build-linux - Linux - suffix '-linux' is appended to installer.basename
build-solaris-sparc - Solaris Sparc - suffix '-solsparc'
build-solaris-x86 - Solaris X86 - suffix '-solx86'
build-windows - Windows - suffix '-win'

Build targets for ML installers (Language support for Japanese (ja) and
Simplified Chinese (zh) is added to English support ie. en,ja,zh support is
present):
build-linux-ml - Linux - suffix '-linux-ml' is appended to installer.basename
build-solaris-sparc-ml - Solaris Sparc - suffix '-solsparc-ml'
build-solaris-x86-ml - Solaris X86 - suffix '-solx86-ml'
build-windows-ml - Windows - suffix '-win-ml'

As there is different command line option for every platform (different
content is installed) it must be run separately for every platform.

The installers will be generated and placed in the directory 'dist'.

jar installers are also generated for i18n testing for every supported
platform.
