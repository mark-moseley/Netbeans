Description: IDE to support development of applications in Java
 NetBeans is a modern IDE which supports development of applications in the
 Java programming language.  The distinctive feature of this IDE is it tries
 hard to support the whole Java platform stack, out of the box.  All important
 Java standard APIs are supported out of the box.  Recently NetBeans started to
 expand its reach beyond Java to C/C++ and other programming languages as well.
