Prerequisites
   
 - InstallShield MultiPlatform 5 (SP3)
 - Apache Ant 1.6.1
 - JDK 1.4.2 (not JDK 1.5 which uses an incompatible classfile format)
 - external unzip utility on $PATH
 - Unix
 - bundled JVM for IS (all four supported platforms are necessary - Win,
   Linux, Solaris-sparc are available at IS web, Solaris-x86 must be created)
   I can provide all 4 bundled JVM. JVM from IS are JRE 1.4.2, Solaris-x86
   is JRE 1.4.2_05). JVMs are placed at:
   $ISMP/jvms/win32/Windows-Sun-1.4.2.exe
   $ISMP/jvms/linux/Linux-Sun-1.4.2.bin
   $ISMP/jvms/solaris/Solaris-Sun-1.4.2.bin
   $ISMP/jvms/solaris/sunjre142_05-solaris-x86-installer.bin
 - installers of JDK 1.5.0 for all 4 supported platforms

To build from command line run ant as usual with

 -Dismp.home=<home dir of ISMP5>
 -Dnb.dir=../../nbbuild/netbeans
 -Dinstaller.basename=NetBeans-dev-20040622
 -Djdk.installer=/mnt/local/jdk.dir.linux/jdk-1_5_0-beta3-bin-b61-linux-i586-02_aug_2004.bin

As there is different command line option for every platform it must be run
separately for every platform.

The installers will be generated and placed in the dist/ subdir
