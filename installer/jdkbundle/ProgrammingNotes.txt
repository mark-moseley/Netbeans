Prerequisites
   
 - InstallShield Universal 11
 - Apache Ant 1.6.3
 - JDK 1.4.2 (not JDK 1.5 which uses an incompatible classfile format)
 - external unzip utility on $PATH
 - Unix
 - bundled JVM are Sun JRE 1.4.2_07 for all 4 supported platforms.
   Location of bundled JVMs is given by alias bundled.jvm.
 - installers of JDK 1.5.0_03 for all 4 supported platforms

To build from command line run ant as usual with

 -Dismp.home=<home dir of ISMP5>
 -Dnb.dir=../../nbbuild/netbeans
 -Dinstaller.basename=NetBeans-jdkbundle-20040622
 -Djdk.installer=/mnt/local/jdk.dir.linux/jdk-1_5_0-beta3-bin-b61-linux-i586-02_aug_2004.bin
 -Dbundled.jvm=/mnt/local/jvms/Linux-Sun-1.4.2.bin
 -Dstorage.builder=../../java/storagebuilder/dist/storagebuilder.jar
 -Dpreparse.files=../../java/storagebuilder/preparse-files.txt

Property storage.builder contains location of storage builder jar file.
 
Property preparse.files contains location of text file with list of classes to
be parsed by storage builder. Colon ':' is used as list separator.

As there is different command line option for every platform it must be run
separately for every platform.

Build targets to build English (en) installers for supported platforms
are as follows:
build-linux - Linux - suffix '-linux' is appended to installer.basename
build-solaris-sparc - Solaris Sparc - suffix '-solsparc'
build-solaris-x86 - Solaris X86 - suffix '-solx86'
build-windows - Windows - suffix '-win'

Build targets to build ML (English - en, Japanese - ja, Simplified Chinese - zh) 
installers for supported platforms are as follows:
build-linux-ml - Linux - suffix '-linux-ml' is appended to installer.basename
build-solaris-sparc-ml - Solaris Sparc - suffix '-solsparc-ml'
build-solaris-x86-ml - Solaris X86 - suffix '-solx86-ml'
build-windows-ml - Windows - suffix '-win-ml'

The installers will be generated and placed in the dist/ subdir
