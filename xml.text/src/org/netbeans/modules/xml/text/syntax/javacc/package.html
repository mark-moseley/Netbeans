<h2>How to use this package</H2>

All Java code in this package is generated using JavaCC tool
from <codE>.jj</CODE> files. It used to exist at
Metamata WWW pages.

<p>
Developer needs to postprocess generated files by erasing
all generated *Stream classes and sources. All <codE>.jj</CODE>
grammars import <code>lib</CODE> subpackage which contains proper
implementation of these interfaces/classes.

<p>
This solution is not clean but current JavaCC and editor module does not
support better solution. Look for <code>lexer.netbeans.org</CODE>
that should provide stream based lexical analysis for editor that is more
suitable for JavaCC generated code.

<p>
XMLSyntax uses more general state stack than DTDSyntax integer array.
(It can be easily copy pasted to DTDSyntax shared text section.)
