 * This class has the same name as JavaCC generated CharStream for

 * UNICODE_INPUT = TRUE
 * <pre>
 * but it behaves as a user char stream. Reason is that 
 * <pre>
 * USER_CHAR_STREAM = TRUE
 * <pre>
 * disables generation of unicode aware code i.e. unicode aware code is generated only
 * for <tt>UNICODE_INPUT</tt> which is mutually exclusive with user char input.
 * <p>
 * Note: Delete JavaCC generated UCode_CharStream and add import statement
 * that makes this class visible.
