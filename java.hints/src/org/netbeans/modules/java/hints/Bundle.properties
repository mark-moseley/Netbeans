# This file contains localized strings used in this package.  The typical
# NetBeans pattern is to use one bundle per-package, called Bundle.properties;
# the openide class NbBundle supports this usage.
#
# Typically, fetch a resource as follows:
# NbBundle.getMessage (MyClass.class, "SOME_Key");
#
# Don't bother caching strings or worse, static references to resource bundles -
# this may seem like its faster, but it wastes memory and slows things down
# in the long run.
