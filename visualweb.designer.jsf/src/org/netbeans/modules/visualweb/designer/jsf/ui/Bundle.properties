These errors are listed below and must be corrected in order to resume visual design of the page.\n\nNote: the markup must be valid JSPX, not HTML. This is similar to XHTML, except that entities must be escaped one extra level, so &nbsp; in XHTML should be written as &amp;nbsp;.\n\nClick on the error to go to its location in the source.\n\nClick Fix HTML Errors to automatically fix some common HTML errors.
