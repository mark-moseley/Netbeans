The <b>UI Gestures Collector</b>    is a portal that allows you to find new tips on how to use NetBeans,    discover what developers using the same technologies do the most, and    also submit feedback to the NetBeans development team.</P><p>    The basic idea is that you tell the server what you do, and the server,     based on received data can generate metrics, statistics, or provide    an advice targeted directly to you on how to use the NetBeans IDE in    a better way.</p><p>    You can now submit data about the UI actions you did in the IDE until now,    and if you do so, the server records them and gives you some     statistics. Right now the whole system is in development mode, so     we are still mostly collecting data, but some basic information comparing    your usage to average usage of all participants in the program shall    nevertheless be available.</p><p>    However your computer seems to be disconnected from the network.     That is why we cannot connect to the server that could handle your submition     request.</p><form action="" method="post">    <input type="hidden" name="submit" disabled="true" value="&amp;Submit Data"></input>    <input type="hidden" name="view-data" value="&amp;View Data" align="left" alt="&amp;Hide Data"></input>    <input type="hidden" name="exit" value="&amp;Cancel"></input></form></BODY></HTML>
