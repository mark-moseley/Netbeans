  <p>
   Proposal of scenarios and UI to satisfy 
   <a href="@TOP@/architecture-summary.html#answer-arch-usecases">usecases</a>
   for UI Gestures Collector.
  </p>

<h1>Scenarios</h1>

<h3>Scenario: We need returning users</h3>

<p>
    Important user actions are recorded and remember in the memory 
    when the UI Gestures Collector is installed. In order for the gesture
    collector to be useful, it is necessary to convince the user to 
    upload these information to our collecting server for processing.
    As we need a wide range of submittions, it is important that the 
    same user continous to submit these logs repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
    When the user is about to exit the IDE, it is presented with a dialog
    describing the purpose of UI Gestures Collector and is encouraged 
    to submit the data to the server by pressing a button. When submitted,
    a new browser window is opened showing confirmation of successful upload,
    thanking the user for doing it and providing some useful information that
    the user may need and would not know otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    The range of "useful information" is wide and can be improved in future,
    however for purposes of this document it is enough to think about it
    just as a inteligent "Tip of the Day". Based on the submitted data and
    possibly the previous UI logs already submitted to the server, it
    is possible to select more appropriate "tip of the Day". In the simplest
    scenario it is definitely possible to find out what project types the
    user is using and not show tips about web projects, if it is writing just
    plain Java applications.
</p>

<p>
    By trading a useful information back for the user's submission of the UI Gestures
    data, we establish an equal and benefitial relationship with them and 
    encourage them to submit the data in future as well. It is believed
    that mutually benefitial approach supports returning customers.
</p>


<h3>Scenario: We need confident users</h3>

<p>
    People do not generally like to send information about themselves to someone
    else. We need to gain a certain amount of trust and convince them that
    sending data gathered by UI Gestures Collector is safe. Indeed one 
    way to built the trust up is the trading of useful information back as 
    described in previous chapter, however this starts to work only for subsequent
    submission, still we need to convince the user that first submission is safe.
</p>

<p>
    To do that the user will be given a chance to view and examine the content
    of the data to be submitted. The main submit screen will have a button to
    open a view of the logged data, the user will be able to browse thru them
    and then submit or cancel the transfer. There will be two views - one 
    human friendly - a tree with records, icons, descriptions, etc.
    Second raw data - some kind of not very human readable XML
    in a text editor that represents the actual data to be sent to the logging
    server.
