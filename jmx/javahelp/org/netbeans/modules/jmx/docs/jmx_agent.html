<h2>Agent Level</h2>
<p>This tier contains the JMX agents used to expose the MBeans. It
provides a specification for implementing agents, which control the
resources and make them available to remote management applications.
Agents are usually located on the same machine as the resources they
manage, but this is not a requirement. The JMX agent consists of an
MBean server and a set of services for handling MBeans. Managers access
an agent's MBeans and use the provided services through a protocol
adaptor or connector. But note that JMX agents do not require knowledge
of the remote management applications that use them.</p>
<p>The main components at the agent level are the MBean Server and
Agent Services.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>MBean Server</b>: A registry of objects that are exposed to
management operations in an agent. Any object registered with the MBean
server becomes visible to management applications. However, note that
the MBean server only exposes an MBean's management interface and never
its direct object reference. Any resources that you want to manage from
outside the agent's JVM must be registered as an MBean in the server.
The server also provides a standardized interface for accessing MBeans
within the same JVM, giving local objects all the benefits of
manipulating manageable resources. MBeans can be instantiated and
registered by another MBean, the agent itself, or a remote management
application through the distributed services. When you register an
MBean, you must assign it a unique object name, which is used by the
management application to identify the object on which to perform a
management operation.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Agent Services</b>: Objects that can perform management
operations on the MBeans registered in the MBean server. By including
management intelligence in the agent, JMX helps you build more powerful
management solutions. The JMX API defines the following Agent Services
available in J2SE 5.0:</li>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Dynamic Class loader</b>: Through the management applet
(m-let) service, retrieves and instantiates new classes and native
libraries from an arbitrary network location.</li>
    <li><b>Monitors</b>: Observe the numerical or string value of an
attribute of several MBeans and can notify other objects of several
types of changes in the target.</li>
    <li><b>Timers</b>: Provide a scheduling mechanism based on a
one-time alarm-clock notification or on a repeated, periodic
notification.</li>
    <li><b>The relation service</b>: Defines associations between
MBeans and enforces the cardinality of the relation based on predefined
relation types.<small></small></li>
  </ul>
