<h2>The JMX Technology Programming Model</h2>
Using JMX to instrument your applications, services, or devices for
manageability is simple. This is because JMX technology shares Java's
object model. If you are familiar with Java and its JavaBeans component
model, you already know 95% of all you need to know.
<p></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, an MBean is a Java object that follows some
standard design patterns and naming conventions. It can represent a
device, application, or any resource that needs to be managed. An MBean
exposes a management interface or a set of readable and/or writable
attributes and a set of invokable operations, along with a
self-description. Note that the management interface does not change
through the life of an MBean instance.<br>
