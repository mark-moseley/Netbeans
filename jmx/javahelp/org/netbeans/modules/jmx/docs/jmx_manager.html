<h2>Manager (or Distributed Services) Level</h2>
<p>This tier contains the components that enable management
applications to communicate with JMX agents. It provides the interfaces
for implementing JMX managers, and defines the management interfaces
and components that operate on agents. Such components provide an
interface for a management application to interact with an agent and
its JMX manageable resources through a connector, and also expose a
management view of a JMX agent and its MBeans by mapping their semantic
meaning into the constructs of a data-rich protocol (such as HTML).<small><br>
