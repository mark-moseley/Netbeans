Here you can register fileobjects, which do not exist on the local filesystem but
whose attribute settings are stored there. This may occur for example when attributes
of a fileobject which exists on the XML filesystem, are changed. Since the XML filesystem
is read-only, new attribute settings are stored on the local filesystem. During upgrading,
which is done from the local filesystem such a fileobject does not exist and
thus its attribute settings are not imported.
