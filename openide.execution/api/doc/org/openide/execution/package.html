<body>

NetBeans uses a small interface to describe the <em>execution</em>

of Java-based classes together with arguments.

<p>The <a href="doc-files/api.html"><b>Execution API</b></a> may be
used both to invoke the preexisting (internal and external) executors,
and to create custom ones. Running processes may be halted, their exit
status may be obtained, and their I/O streams will be displayed.

<p>The API, in conjunction with the Datasystems API, also supports
association of a specific executor to a given class (file), which can
be used to provide special execution support for objects such as
applets or servlets.
