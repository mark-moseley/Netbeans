OpenIDE-Module-Name=JPDA Debugger Ant Task
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Debugging
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Lets you use the NetBeans JPDA debugger from Ant.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Defines two Ant tasks which may be placed in an Ant script: <nbjpdaconnect> \
    and <nbjpdastart>. Both tasks can only be run inside the NetBeans IDE. The \
    <nbjpdaconnect> task, when run, it will ask the NetBeans JPDA debugger to \
    attach to a remote process. The effect is similar to the \
    Debug -> Start Session -> Attach... menu item. \
    You would typically use it inside <parallel> to start the remote process \
    and attach to it. The <nbjpdastart> on the other hand will start \
    NetBeans JPDA debugger in server listening mode and target process can \
    then connect to it.
