<h2>Sharing Form Files</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can share files that consist of a form in a Collaboration session. When you share form files, only the file owner can make changes; remote file sharers cannot make changes to the form files.</p>
<p><b>To share a form file:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the shared file or right-click the file and choose Open from the contextual menu.<br>
The opened file has an annotation on its document tab to show that it is a shared file.</li>
<li>Begin editing the form file. </li>
<li>When you are finished, click the Save button.<br>
A message appears asking you whether you want to synchronize files (&quot;Sync Files&quot;).</li>
<li>Click OK to allow other participants in the conversation to see the changed form file.</li>
</ol>
