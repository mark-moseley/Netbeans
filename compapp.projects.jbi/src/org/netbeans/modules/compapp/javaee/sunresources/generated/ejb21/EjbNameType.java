/**
 * 
 * 	
 * 
 * 	  The ejb-nameType specifies an enterprise bean's name. It is
 * 	  used by ejb-name elements. This name is assigned by the
 * 	  ejb-jar file producer to name the enterprise bean in the
 * 	  ejb-jar file's deployment descriptor. The name must be
 * 	  unique among the names of the enterprise beans in the same
 * 	  ejb-jar file.
 * 
 * 	  There is no architected relationship between the used
 * 	  ejb-name in the deployment descriptor and the JNDI name that
 * 	  the Deployer will assign to the enterprise bean's home.
 * 
 * 	  The name for an entity bean must conform to the lexical
 * 	  rules for an NMTOKEN.
 * 
 * 	  Example:
 * 
 * 	  <ejb-name>EmployeeService</ejb-name>
 * 
 *
