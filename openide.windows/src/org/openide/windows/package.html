Most parts of the IDE do not manipulate windows directly, but use
special

<a href="http://top/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html"><em>top components</em></a>.

<p>The

<a href="http://top/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html"><b>Window System API</b></a>

provides the ability for modules to create window-like components which
can, among other things:

<ol>

<li>Be docked as tabs into a container window.

<li>Provide popup menus in their window icon or tab.

<li>Handle activation and node selections.

<li>Provide the ability to be cloned, and the clones monitored.

</ol>
