MSG_SessionRunning={0} cannot be executed when a debugging session is running. Do you want to close the debugging session and execute the {0}?

MSG_FinishSession=JSP/Servlet debugging is not available right now because there is other remote debugging session active on same server. IDE will automatically close the session and start a new one.
