<P>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</P> \
<P>Welcome to Sun Microsystems Developer Collaboration. Sun \
Microsystems provides this service to you, subject to the following \
Terms of Service (&quot;TOS&quot;) , which may be updated by us from \
time to time without notice to you. You can review the most current \
version of the TOS at any time at: http://sun.com.  \
</P> \
<P>BY CLICKING THE &quot;I ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON (IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD \
AND INSTALL SUN MICROSYSTEMS DEVELOPER COLLABORATION ON YOUR \
COMPUTER) YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE SOFTWARE LICENSE AND TOS.</P> \
<P>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</P> \
<P>Sun Microsystems Developer Collaboration (the &quot;Service&quot;) \
provides users with the capability to see when their friends are \
online, send and receive instant messages, share files, receive \
alerts, and other material and information via the Internet. By \
registering and using the Service, you acknowledge that other users \
of the Service may elect to receive a notification from the Service \
when you sign on and may send you instant messages and other \
information via the Service.  If you desire to block the notification \
feature of the Service sent to other users or if you don't want to \
receive messages from such users, you can enable the &quot;Invisible&quot; \
feature of the Service.  By using the Service, you agree that Sun \
Microsystems has no responsibility for the assessment, or for \
resolving any disputes arising from a User's ability to ignore, send \
messages or otherwise use the Service.</P> \
<P>In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the World \
Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access web-based \
content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In \
addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such \
connection to the World Wide Web, including a computer and modem or \
other access device. \
</P> \
<P>All Software provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to \
solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is provided with \
the commercial rights and restrictions described herein. In addition, \
you agree that the Software may not be acquired, shipped, \
transported, exported, or reexported (1) into (or to a national or \
resident of) any U.S. embargoed country or (2) to anyone on the U.S. \
Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the \
U.S. Department of Commerce's Table of Denial Orders.  By using the \
Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, \
under control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on \
any such list.</P> \
<P>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment \
or enhance the current Service, shall be subject to the Software \
License and this Terms of Use. You understand and agree that the \
Service is provided &quot;AS-IS&quot; and that Sun Microsystems \
assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery \
or failure to store any user communications or personalization \
settings. You also understand that Sun Microsystems is not \
responsible for the security or privacy of communications sent via \
the Service where the Service is being accessed via wireless devices. \
</P> \
<P>3.  DATA TRANSMITTED AND COLLECTED BY THE SERVICE</P> \
<P>&bull; The Service requires you to obtain a Sun Microsystems \
Developer Collaboration  ID and password and transmits this \
information to Sun Microsystems  when you launch the program to \
verify your identity.  Sun Microsystems  also stores your preferences \
and profile settings, which you control.</P> \
<P>&bull; When you add a friend to your contact list, your friend's \
ID is stored on our servers and is linked with your friend list and \
vice versa. We use this information to display a list of your online \
friends when you are using the program.  If you choose to store \
additional information about a friend on your contact list through \
the Contact Info function, Sun Microsystems will store this \
information.  If you choose to &quot;ignore&quot; certain users \
through your preference settings, that user's Sun Microsystems  ID is \
stored on our server in order to fulfill your ignore request.</P> \
<P>.&bull; When you use the Service, your instant messages (&quot;IMs&quot;) \
may be transmitted through our servers on their way to the recipient, \
or, in the case of a conference, recipients. Any files you transmit \
through the Service may also be transmitted through our servers.  \
</P> \
<P>&bull; Unless you log in to the Service using the &quot;invisible \
mode,&quot; your online status will be visible to other the Service \
users who have you on their friends list. You can turn this off in \
your preference settings.  \
</P> \
<P>&bull; You have certain choices about whether to add friends, be \
added as a friend, or ignore other users. \
</P> \
<P>&bull; Sun Microsystems does not save your messages.</P> \
<P>&bull; By using the Service, you may choose to make some of your \
personal information public or you may choose to share some of your \
personal information with others.  If you post personal information \
online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited \
messages from other parties in return.</P> \
<P>&bull; The Service initially connects with Sun Microsystems, but \
sometimes uses a peer-to-peer connection during its operation, \
including times when you may be using it for instant messaging \
(including text, mobile), file sharing, voice, and webcam streaming. \
Peer-to-peer means that your computer connects directly to the other \
user's computer in the conversation without needing to go through Sun \
Microsystems servers. As such, your IP address is available to users \
you share a peer-to-peer connection with.   \
</P> \
<P>4.  ADVERTISING IN THE SERVICE</P> \
<P>&bull; The graphical user interface for the Service may display \
banner advertising to you from time to time in or around your friend \
list or on one of the optional tabs that allow you to view other Sun \
Microsystems services.</P> \
<P>&bull; Certain versions of the Service allow you to send and \
receive images from a webcam. When you view another person's webcam, \
the window in which their image is displayed may contain \
advertisements that change periodically as long as the window is \
open. Closing the window ends the display of these advertisements.</P> \
<P>&bull; Certain versions of the Service include a Call Center by \
which you may place computer to phone calls over the internet. The \
window in which you dial a telephone number may contain a banner \
advertisement that changes periodically as long as the window is \
open. Closing the window ends the display of this advertisement.</P> \
<P>&bull; If you type a search into the query box provided in some \
versions of the Service, results of your search will be displayed in \
a web browser.</P> \
<P>5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</P> \
<P>If you don't already have a Sun Microsystems Developer \
Collaboration ID and password, you will be prompted to complete the \
Microsystems Developer Collaboration registration process.  You are \
responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and \
account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur \
under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify \
Sun Microsystems of any unauthorized use of your password or account \
or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from \
your account at the end of each session. Sun Microsystems cannot and \
will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure \
to comply with this Section 5. The Service may allow you to \
communicate with users of other instant messaging products.  In that \
event, you acknowledge and agree that (i) your use of the Service is \
subject to the Software License and the terms governing the use of \
other instant messaging products you have agreed to, if any, that are \
consistent with the Software License and (ii) users of other instant \
messaging products are subject to the terms governing such other \
instant messaging products.  Sun Microsystems assumes no \
responsibility for the conduct or content of messages sent by users \
of other instant messaging products.</P> \
