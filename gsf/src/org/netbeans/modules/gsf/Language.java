/**
 * @todo Should languages get to declared "priorities"? In case there are
 *    overlaps in extensions that is.
 * @todo Can I devise a way where one language can "extend" another?
 *    For example, the Jackpot Rule language should simply be the Java language
 *    with a couple of simple changes.
 * @todo Add LanguageVersion list property. For example, for Java, they could be
 *    JDK 1.4, 5.0, 6.0. This would be exposed as a property somewhere (perhaps
 *    on a project basis) and would be used by plugins to drive parser specific
 *    info.  Similarly for JavaScript I have multiple language versions - 1.0 through 1.6
 *    in the case of Rhino (corresponding to different JavaScript/EcmaScript versions).
