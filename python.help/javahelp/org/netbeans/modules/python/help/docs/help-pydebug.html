        <h3>About Debugging applications</h3>
        <p>Debugging is the process of examining your application for errors.
            The process of debugging is accomplished by setting breakpoints and
            watches in your code and running it in the debugger.
            This enables you to execute your code one line at a time and examine
        the state of your application in order to discover any problems.</p>

        <h3>Setting up your project for debugging</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Check Debugger's Options:</b> Go to <b>Tools > Options > Python </b> and
            click on the <b>Debugger</b> tab :</li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Debugger listening starting port:</b> When debugging, for better
                    isolation the debugger is automatically started in a separate
                    process and communicates with Netbeans IDE over an IP socket.
                    This field specifies the port number where the debugger process
                is listening for incoming Netbeans Python debugging solicitations. </li>
                <li><b>Debugging shell colors and fonts:</b>This group of button may be used to customized
                the debugging shell coloring</li>

                <li><b>Stop at first line: </b> When checked the debugger will initially stop at the
                    first line of the debugger's script. When unchecked the debugger will stop at
                the first found breakpoint in script.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Setting the breakpoints:</b> In the Source Editor, click in the left
            margin next to the desired line, where you want to set a breakpoint.</li>


        </ol>
        <h3>Starting the debugger</h3>
        <p>After the breakpoints have been set, click on <b>Debug</b> and select
        the appropriate option to start the debugging session
        <ul>
            <li>If there is more than one project open, <b>Ctrl + F5</b> will start the
            debugging session on the main project</li>
            <li>To start off a debugging session on any particular Python file,
            focus on the file and then the keystroke <b>Ctrl + Shift + F5</b> will
            start the debugging session</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h3>Debugger Windows</h3>
        <p>Besides the default shell window, there are other windows which display
        other runtime configuration of the application currently being debugged:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Call Stack Window</b></li>
            <li><b>Local Variables Window</b></li>
            <li><b>Threads Window</b></li>
        </ol></p>
    </body>
