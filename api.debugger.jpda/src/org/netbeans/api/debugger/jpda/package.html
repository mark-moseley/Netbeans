<body>
JPDA Debugger APIs provide representation of JDI functionality. Interfaces in
org.netbeans.api.debugger.jpda package correspond to appropriate JDI interfaces.
<br>
<br>
<pre style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">
Since JDI interfaces evolve from one version to another, it's strongly recommended
not to implement any interface in this package. New methods can be added to
these interfaces at any time to keep up with the JDI functionality.</pre>
