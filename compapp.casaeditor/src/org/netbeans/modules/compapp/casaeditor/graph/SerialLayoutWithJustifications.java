/**
 * This is a SerialLayout which modified "justify" for right alignment of children.
 * 
 * The regular layout can't RIGHT align child to that of parent right bound, because parent bounds are not yet known.
 * Once all the layout's sizes determined, then "justify" will be called and this justify right align the children.
