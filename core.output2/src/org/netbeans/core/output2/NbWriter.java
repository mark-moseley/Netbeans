/**
 * Wrapper around a replacable instance of OutWriter.  An OutWriter can be disposed on any thread, but it may
 * still be visible in the GUI until the tab change gets handled in the EDT;  also, a writer once obtained
 * should be reusable, but OutWriter is useless once it has been disposed.  So this class wraps an OutWriter,
 * which it replaces when reset() is called;  an OutputDocument is implemented directly over an 
 * OutWriter, so the immutable OutWriter lasts until the OutputDocument is destroyed.
