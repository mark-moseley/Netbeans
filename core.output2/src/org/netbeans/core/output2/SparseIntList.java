/**
 * A sparsely populated list of integers, internally implemented as two
 * arrays of integers - one containing sequential indices that have been entered,
 * and one the values associated with those integers.  Calls to get() for values
 * in between or greater than values that have really been added will return
 * the value of the nearest lower added entry that has been added plus the interval
 * between that entry and the index requested.  So, if you have such a list, 
 * it works as follows:
 * <p>
 * Entries are added with an associated index.  If get() is called for a 
 * value > the last entered index, the value returned is the last entered 
 * index + the difference between the requested index and the last entered
 * index.  When a value is requested that is between recorded indices, it
 * will find the nearest lower recorded index.
 * <p>
 * So, if you call add (20, 10), then get(0)==0, get(9) == 9, get(10) == 10 (no
 * that is not a typo! After adding <i>at</i> 10, get(10) returns 10 - indices
 * <i>after</i> that are what's affected),
 * get(11) == 21, get(12) == 22, and so forth.  Elements must be added in
 * sequential order - that is, on any call to add, the index argument must
 * be > the index argument the last time it was called, and the same for the
 * value argument.
 * <p>
 * This is used to handle caching of logical line lengths in OutWriter -
 * if we have a 400000 line file, most lines will typically not need to be
 * word wrapped.  So we don't want to create a 400000 element int[] if most
 * of the time the number of wrapped lines will turn out to be 1 - instead,
 * only lines that are actually wrapped will have a line count added to a
 * SparseIntList; its get() behavior takes care of returning correct values
 * for the non-wrapped lines in between.
