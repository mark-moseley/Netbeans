/**
 * <p><strong>AbstractSessionBean</strong> is the abstract base class for
 * data bean(s) that are stored in session scope attributes.  It extends
 * {@link FacesBean}, so it inherits all of the default behavior
 * found there.  In addition, the following lifecycle methods are called
 * automatically when the corresponding events occur:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>init()</code> - Called when this bean is initially added
 *     as a session attribute (typically as the result of evaluating a
 *     value binding or method binding expression).</li>
 * <li><code>passivate()</code> - Called when the servlet container is about
 *     to serialize and remove this session from its current container.</li>
 * <li><code>activate()</code> - Called when the servlet container has
 *     finished deserializing this session and making it available in a
 *     (potentially different) container.</li>
 * <li><code>destroy()</code> - Called when the bean is removed from the
 *     session attributes (typically as a result of the session timing out
 *     or being terminated by the application).</li>
 * </ul>
