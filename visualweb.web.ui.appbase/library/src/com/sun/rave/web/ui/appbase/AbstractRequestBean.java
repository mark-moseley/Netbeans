 * {@link FacesBean}, so it inherits all of the default behavior
 * found there.  In addition, the following lifecycle methods are called
 * automatically when the corresponding events occur:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>init()</code> - Called when this bean is initially added as a
 *     request scope attribute (typically as the result of
 *     evaluating a value binding or method binding expression).</li>
 * <li><code>destroy()</code> - Called when the bean is removed from the
 *     request attributes (typically as a result of the application
 *     being shut down by the servlet container).</li>
