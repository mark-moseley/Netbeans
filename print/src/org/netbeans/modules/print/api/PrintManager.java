/**
 * <p class="nonnormative">
 * The Print Manager is powerful functionality to preview and
 * send data out to printer. Print Preview action from <code>File</code>
 * menu (<code>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P</code> shortcut) invokes the Print Preview
 * dialog. The Print Preview dialog provides page layout, the set of options
 * including font, color, header, footer, printer settings such as paper size
 * and orientation, number of copies, margins, collation and system properties.</p>
 *
 * There are several ways to enable print preview for a custom data:<p>
 *
 * If the data is a Swing component which extends {@linkplain javax.swing.JComponent}
 * and shown in a {@link org.openide.windows.TopComponent}, the key
 * {@linkplain #PRINT_PRINTABLE} with value <code>"Boolean.TRUE"</code>
 * in the component must be set as a client property, see example:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * public class CustomComponent extends javax.swing.JComponent {
 *   public CustomComponent() {
 *     ...
 *     putClientProperty("print.printable", Boolean.TRUE); // NOI18N
 *   }
 *   ...
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * The key {@linkplain #PRINT_NAME} is used to specify the name of the component
 * which will be printed in the header/footer:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * putClientProperty("print.name", &lt;name&gt;); // NOI18N</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * If the key is not set at all, the display name of the top
 * component is used by default. The content of the header/footer
 * can be adjusted in the Print Options dialog.<p>
 *
 * If the custom data is presented by several components, all of them can
 * be enabled for print preview. The key {@linkplain #PRINT_WEIGHT} is used for
 * this purpose, all visible and printable components are sorted by weight
 * and shown in the Print Preview dialog from the left to right:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * putClientProperty("print.weight", &lt;weight&gt;); // NOI18N</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * If the custom data is presented by another classes, a provider
 * {@linkplain org.netbeans.modules.print.spi.PrintProvider} should be implemented
 * and put in the lookup of the top component where the custom data lives.
 *
 * @see org.netbeans.modules.print.spi.PrintProvider

   *
   * How does Print Manager decide what to preview?<p>
   *
   * At first, the manager searches {@linkplain org.netbeans.modules.print.spi.PrintProvider}
   * in the lookup of the active top component {@link org.openide.windows.TopComponent}.
   * If a print provider is found, it is used by the print manager for preview.
   * Otherwise, it tries to obtain printable components (marked as {@linkplain #PRINT_PRINTABLE})
   * among the descendants of the active top component. All found printable components
   * are passed into the Print Preview dialog.<p>
   * 
   * If there are no printable components, printable data are retrieved from the selected
   * nodes {@link org.openide.nodes.Node} of the active top component: the manager
   * searches {@linkplain org.netbeans.modules.print.spi.PrintProvider} in the lookups
   * of the nodes. All pages {@linkplain org.netbeans.modules.print.spi.PrintPage},
   * taken from found providers, are displayed in the preview.<p>
   * 
   * If nodes don't have print providers in lookups, the manager gets the cookie
   * {@link org.openide.cookies.EditorCookie} from the {@link org.openide.loaders.DataObject}
   * of the nodes. The {@linkplain javax.swing.text.StyledDocument} documents, returned by
   * the editor cookies, contain printing information (text, font, color). This information
   * is shown in the print preview. So, any textual documents (java sources, html, xml, plain
   * text etc.) are printable by default.
