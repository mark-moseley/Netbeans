/**
 * The Print manager is powerful functionality to preview and
 * send data out to printer. Print Preview action from <code>File</code>
 * menu (<code>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P</code> shortcut) invokes Print Preview
 * dialog for selected nodes or opened views. The Print Preview dialog
 * provides page layout, the set of options including font, color, header,
 * footer, printer settings such as paper size and orientation, number
 * of copies, margins, collation and system properties.<p>
 *
 * There are several ways to enable print preview for a custom data:<p>
 *
 * If the data is a Swing component which extends
 * <code>javax.swing.JComponent</code> and is shown in a
 * <code>org.openide.windows.TopComponent</code>,
 * not <code>null</code> key <code>"java.awt.print.Printable.class"</code>
 * in the component should be set, see example:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * public class CustomComponent extends JComponent {
 *   public CustomComponent() {
 *     ...
 *     putClientProperty(java.awt.print.Printable.class, "&lt;name&gt;");
 *   }
 *   ...
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * The second argument in method <code>putClientProperty</code> is a
 * name, which is shown at the top/bottom of the print preview as the header/footer,
 * which can be changed in the Print Options dialog. If empty name is passed,
 * the display name of the top component is shown.<p>
 *
 * If the dimension of the custom component for printing differs from visual
 * dimension, specify this:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * putClientProperty(Dimension.class, new Dimension(printWidth, printHeight));</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * If custom data is presented by several components, all of them can be enabled
 * in print preview. For this purpose, the order of the components
 * (from the left to right) should be defined:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * putClientProperty(java.lang.Integer.class, new Integer(<weight>));</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * where <code>weight</code> is integer value.<p>
 *
 * If custom data is presented by another classes, print provider
 * (see <code>PrintProvider</code>) should be implemented and put it
 * into the lookup of a node, data object or top component where the
 * data lives.
