<h2>Customizing a Tomcat Server</h2>
<p><small>

</small></p> 
<p>You open the Tomcat Instance property sheet from a server's instance node in 
  the Runtime window. A Tomcat instance node has the following properties.</p>
<h3>Properties Section</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Server Port.</b> The number of the TCP/IP port that the server listens 
    on. The URL for a web module that is deployed on the server is derived from 
    the host's URL and the server port, such as <tt>http://localhost:8086</tt>.</li>
  <li><b>Admin Port.</b> The number of the TCP/IP port that the server's administrative 
    server listens to.</li>
  <li><b>User.</b> The user name that the IDE uses to log into the server's manager 
    application. The user must be associated with the manager role. The first 
    time the IDE starts the server, such as through the Start/Stop Server menu 
    action or by executing a web component from the IDE, the IDE adds an admin 
    user with a randomly-generated password to the <i>tomcat-base-path</i><tt>/conf/tomcat-users.xml</tt> 
    file. The entry looks similar to the following: 
    <PRE>  &lt;user username=&quot;ide&quot; password=&quot;woiehh&quot; roles=&quot;manager&quot;/&gt;</PRE>
  </li>
  <li><b>Password.</b> The user's password.</li>
  <li><b>Home Directory.</b> The home directory for the server on your local system. 
    This property is set when you add a Tomcat server to the Server Registry. 
    This location is where Tomcat expects to find its own binaries and any libraries 
    that are used by web modules but which are not part of Tomcat itself.</li>
  <li><b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory for the Tomcat server. You can 
    set this property when you add a Tomcat server to the Server Registry. If 
    you set a base directory, then that is where the Tomcat configuration files 
    will reside. One reason for specifying a separate base directory is to allow 
    more than one user to use the same server. If no base directory is specified, 
    then the configuration files reside in the home directory.</li>
  <li><b>Enable HTTP Monitor.</b> Select this checkbox to enable the HTTP Monitor 
    for web modules executing on the server. When enabling the monitor, you must 
    restart the server in order for the change to take affect. The HTTP Monitor 
    is useful for debugging web modules. If you are using the server for production 
    purposes only, you may want to clear the checkbox to reduce its impact on 
    the server's performance. When you clear the checkbox, the IDE removes the 
    HTTP monitor's declaration from the server. However the monitor's libraries 
    remain deployed to the server.</li>
  </li>
  When you disable the HTTP Monitor, you do not need to restart the server for 
  the change to take affect. 
</ul>
<h3>Debugger Section</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Debugger Port.</b> Specifies the port number that the server uses for 
    debugging.</li>
  <li><b>Classic.</b> Select the checkbox to use the &quot;classic&quot; JDK 1.1 
    JVM for debugging. Clear the box to use HotSpot JVM<b>.</b></li>
  <li><b>Debugging Type.</b> Choose one of the following types to specify how 
    the IDE should connect to the server being debugged: 
    <ul>
      <li>Socket </li>
      <li>(Windows only) Shared memory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>(Windows only) Name.</b> Use this property to specify the identification 
    string for shared memory access. To change the string, click the ellipsis 
    button (...) to display the Name property editor. In the property editor, 
    type a name, and click OK.</li>
</ul>
