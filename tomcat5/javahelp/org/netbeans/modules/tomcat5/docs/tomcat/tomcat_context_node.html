<h2>Tomcat Web Applications Node</h2>
<p><small> 
<a href="#seealso">See Also</a> 
</small></p> 
<p>The web applications node <img src="../images/mfolder.gif">&nbsp;lists 
  the web application contexts that have been deployed to the server. It appears 
  under the server's instance in the Services window. </p>
<p>The IDE adds a web application's context node <img src="../images/webmodule.gif">&nbsp;
the first time you execute the web application 
  from the IDE.</p>
<p>When the server receives a HTTP request, the server selects the web application 
  for processing the request by matching the longest possible prefix of the Request 
  URI against all of the defined context paths.</p>
<h3>Working With This Node</h3>
<p>If you right-click the web application node and display the contextual menu, you 
  can choose Refresh to bring the contents of the node up-to-date.</p>
<h3>Working With the Web Application's Context Nodes </h3>
<p>If you right-click one of the web application's context nodes and display the contextual 
  menu, you see a list of menu items that enable you to work with the context. 
  The following list describes these menu items and provides links to topics that 
  explain more.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Start.</b> Restarts a stopped web application.</li>
  <li><b>Stop.</b> Disables the web application so that no one can run it. You 
    can use this action to prevent others from using the web application while 
    fixing or modifying it. If someone tries to run a stopped web application, 
    the server returns HTTP Status 503, which indicates that the application is 
    not currently available.</li>
  <li><b>Open in Browser.</b> Opens the selected web application's URL in the IDE's
    default browser. This item is enabled when the server is running.</li>
   <li><b>Undeploy.</b> Removes the web application's context from the server. The IDE 
    will recreate the context if the web application is subsequently executed from 
    the IDE.</li>
</ul>
