<h2>About The Tomcat Server</h2>
<p><small>

<h3>The Tomcat Plugin</h3>
The Tomcat Plugin is an IDE module that handles integration with Tomcat
  servers.</p>
<p>A Tomcat server is bundled with the IDE and is pre-configured to work with 
  the plugin. The Tomcat server implements the JavaServer Pages 2.0 and Servlet 
  2.4 specifications and includes many features that are useful in the deployment 
  of web applications.</p>
<p>You can also configure the Tomcat plugin to integrate with other supported 
  Tomcat servers. See <a href="tomcat_addinstall.html">Adding a Tomcat Server</a>.</p>
<p>To see the Tomcat servers that the Tomcat Plugin manages, expand Server Registry 
  in the Runtime window and expand the Tomcat 5 Servers node.</p>
<p>For more information, see the following web sites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extensive information about Tomcat web server internals is available at 
    <tt>http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat</tt></li>
  <li>The <i>JavaServer Pages Specification</i> is available at <tt>http://java.sun.com/products/jsp</tt></li>
  <li>The <em>Java Servlet Specification</em> is available at <tt>http://java.sun.com</tt><tt>/products/servlet</tt></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bundled Tomcat Server</h3>
<p>When you install the IDE, the installation automatically adds the bundled Tomcat 
  server to the IDE's server registry.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top"> 
    <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
    <td> You can also configure the IDE to deploy web applications to other installations 
      of Tomcat. See <a href="tomcat_addinstall.html">Adding 
      a Tomcat Installation</a> for more information. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The configuration files for the bundled Tomcat server are in the Tomcat <i>base</i> 
  directory, located under your IDE user directory. The Tomcat <i>home</i> directory 
  is under the IDE installation directory. Note that this setup differs from a 
  typical Tomcat installation, where the base directory and home directory coincide. 
  To see the exact locations of the home and base directories, right-click the 
  server's node in the Runtime tab and choose Properties from the contextual menu. 
</p>
<p>Shared libraries that are used by web applications must be added to the home directory. 
  Do not add shared libraries to the base directory.</p>
<table>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top"><img src="../images/warn.gif" width="16" height="16"></td>
    <td valign=top align=left> <p>Developers using a common IDE installation need 
        to exercise caution when adding shared libraries to the home directory. 
        Libraries stored in the home directory are shared by all web applications that 
        are deployed on the server, so the potential for version conflicts exists.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>On the UNIX platform, the IDE is sometimes installed in a read-only directory. 
  If this is the case, you will not be able to add shared libraries to the bundled 
  Tomcat installation. Ask the person responsible for the IDE installation to 
  make writable all directories under the Tomcat home directory. Alternatively, 
  you could add another Tomcat server and configure it to meet your needs. </p>
