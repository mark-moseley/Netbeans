<h2>Setting a Username and Password for the Tomcat Manager</h2>

<p>It would be quite unsafe to ship web servers with default settings that allowed 
anyone on the Internet to execute them on your server. 
Therefore, the web servers are shipped with the requirement that anyone 
who attempts to use them must authenticate themselves, using a username and password 
with the appropriate role associated with them.</p> 

<p>For example, to authenticate yourself when you want to use
   the Tomcat Manager to deploy your web application, 
   JSP file, or servlet, you need a username
   and password for a user with the "manager" role. 
   This username and password are defined in the
   <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file that is in your user
   directory.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
	 You can only use the usernames and passwords that are defined in  
	 your NetBeans <b>user</b> directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file, 
	 and not those that are in the NetBeans <b>installation</b> directory.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>
<p>
   During installation, the NetBeans IDE generates a user
   called "ide" that is assigned the "manager" role. This
   user is created in your user directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file.</p>
<p><b>To get the password for the "ide" username from your user directory:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click
   the Tomcat Server instance node in the Runtime window and select Properties.
   In the Properties
   dialog box, the Base Directory property points to the
   <i>base-dir</i><tt></tt> directory.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the path to Tomcat's base directory.</li>
  <li>In your system, go to Tomcat's base directory and then to its 
  <tt>\conf</tt> subfolder.</li>
  <li>Open the <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file and make a note of the password
  that is defined for the "ide" username.</li>
</ol>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
	 The username and password are <b>not</b> saved when you enter them
	 in this dialog box. The username and password are only saved if
	 you define them in the Tomcat Server's Properties dialog box. 
	 To open the Properties dialog box, right-click the Tomcat Server's 
	 instance node in the Runtime window and select
	 Properties.
