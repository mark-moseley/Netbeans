<h2>Configuring Tomcat Manager Application Access</h2>
<p><small> 
<a href="#seealso">See Also</a> 
</small></p> 
<p>It would be quite unsafe to ship Tomcat with default settings that allowed 
anyone on the Internet to execute the Manager application on your server. 
Therefore, the Manager application is shipped with the requirement that anyone 
who attempts to use it must authenticate themselves, using a username and password 
that have the role "manager" associated with them. 

There is a username called "ide" in the default users file 
that is assigned the "manager" role.<p> 
Do the following to get the password for the "ide" username:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select Help <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;About 
  from the main menu and choose the Detail tab.</li>
  <li>Make a note of the path to the User Dir folder.</li>
  <li>In your file system, go to your User Dir and then to 
  jakarta-tomcat-5.0.27_base\conf.</li>
  <li>Open tomcat-users.xml and make a note of the password
  that is defined for the "ide" username.</li>
</ol>
