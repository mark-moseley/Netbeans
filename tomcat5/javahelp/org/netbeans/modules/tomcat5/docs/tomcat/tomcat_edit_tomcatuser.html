<h2>Setting a Username and Password for the Tomcat Manager</h2>

<p>It would not be safe to ship web servers with default settings that allowed 
anyone on the Internet to execute them on your server. 
Therefore, web servers are shipped with the requirement that anyone 
who attempts to use them must authenticate themselves, using a username and password 
with the appropriate role associated with them.</p> 

<p>For example, the Tomcat Web Server uses the Tomcat Manager to run web applications.
   To authenticate yourself when you run your web application, 
   JSP file, or servlet, you need a username
   and password for a user with the "manager" role. 
   This username and password are defined in the
   <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file that is in your user
   directory.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
	 You can only use the usernames and passwords that are defined in  
	 the IDE user directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file, 
	 and not those that are in the IDE installation directory's
	 <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>
<p>
   During installation, the IDE generates a user
   called ide for use with the bundled Tomcat Server. This user
   is assigned the "manager" role and
   is created in your user directory's <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file.</p>
   <p><b>To set the username and password for the Tomcat Manager:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In your system, go to Tomcat's base directory and then to its 
  <tt>\conf</tt> subfolder.
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
   If you don't know where Tomcat's base directory is,
   right-click
   the Tomcat Server instance node in the Runtime window and select Properties.
   In the Properties
   dialog box, the Base Directory property points to the
   base directory.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table></li>
  <li>Open the <tt>tomcat-users.xml</tt> file and make a note of the password
  that is defined for the ide username.</li>
  <li>Right-click
   the Tomcat Server instance node in the Runtime window and select Properties.
   In the Properties
   dialog box, type the username and password.</li>
</ol>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr valign="top">
      <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
	      If the username and password have not been specified, a dialog
	      box appears when you run a web application, JSP file, or servlet.
	 If you specify the username and password in this dialog box,
	 they are not saved. The username and password are only saved if
	 you define them in the Tomcat Server instance's Properties dialog box.
