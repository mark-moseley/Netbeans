/**
 * Interface to be implemented by an action whose behavior

 * is bound to the provided context: {@link Action#isEnabled},
 * {@link Action#actionPerformed}, etc. may be specific to that context.
 * <p class="nonnormative">For example, the action representing a context menu item will usually implement
 * this interface. When the actual context menu is created, rather than making a
 * presenter for the generic action, the menu will contain a presenter for the
 * context-aware instance. The context will then be taken from the GUI
 * environment where the context menu was shown; for example it may be a
 * <a href="@org-openide-windows@/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html#getLookup()">TopComponent's context</a>,
 * often taken from an activated node selection. The context action might be
 * enabled only if a certain "cookie" is present in that selection. When invoked,
 * the action need not search for an object to act on, since it can use the context.
