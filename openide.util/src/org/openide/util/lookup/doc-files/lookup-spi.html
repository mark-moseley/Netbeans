<TITLE>Lookup Library SPI</TITLE>

<BODY>
<H1>Lookup library SPI</H1>
This document describe usage of the SPI provided by the Lookup Library
(for those seeking how to use lookup instance please
check <A href="lookup-api.html">the API document</A>).
<p>
By using the SPI you can create lookups that can be used by the users of the
Lookup API. While the Lookup API consists of a couple of classes in the package
<em>org.openide.util.*</EM>,
the SPI has its own package <em>org.openide.util.lookup.*</EM>.

<H2> Simple lookups </H2>
Let us start with the simplest case. You have decided that your newly created
object will provide an API in the form of a getLookup() method. You have to
return a functional lookup from this call. You can use static methods in class
<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html">
<code>Lookups</code></A> to create a lookup for you. If you want only one
object to be returned, just call 
<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#singleton(java.lang.Object)">
<code>Lookups.singleton(x)</code></A> where x is the object to be 
returned by the lookup. Or if you want to supply more objects, use a call to the method
<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#fixed(java.lang.Object...)">
<code>fixed(Object []x)</CODE></A>.
<EM> Note: </EM> The lookups returned from methods <code>singleton(...)</code> and
<code>fixed(...)</code> do <EM>
not </EM> support dynamic changes and attaching listeners. Their content is
fixed from the time you call the creating method.

<H2> ProxyLookup </H2>
There can be situations where you get a lookup object from someone else and you
want your lookup to return exactly the instances from the original lookup plus
your own results. Here the class ProxyLookup comes into the play.
<p>
You simply create a new lookup like this:

<pre>
    <font class="keyword">import</FONT> org.openide.util.Lookup;
    <font class="keyword">import</FONT> org.openide.util.lookup.*;

    <font class="type">Lookup</font> <font class="variable-name">lookup1</font> = ...;

    <font class="type">Lookup</font> <font class="variable-name">lookup2</font> = Lookups.singleton(MyService.<font class="keyword">class</font>);
    <font class="keyword">return</font> <font class="keyword">new</font> <font class="type">ProxyLookup</font>(<font class="keyword">new</font> <font class="type">Lookup</font>[] { lookup, lookup2 });
</pre>

<H2> AbstractLookup </H2>
<!-- This paragraph originally copied from
@TOP@org/openide/doc-files/services-api.html#lookup-impl
-->

<p>The most powerful way to provide a lookup is to directly define
what instances and items it should provide, by subclassing. For this,

<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/AbstractLookup.html"><code>AbstractLookup</code></a>

is recommended as it is easiest to use.

<p>The simplest way to use <code>AbstractLookup</code> is to use its
public constructor (in which case you need not subclass it). Here you
provide an

<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/AbstractLookup.Content.html"><code>AbstractLookup.Content</code></a>

object which you have created and hold on to privately, and which
keeps track of instances and permits them to be registered and
deregistered. Often

<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.html"><code>InstanceContent</code></a>

is used as the content implementation. To add something to the lookup,
simply use

<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.html#add(java.lang.Object)"><code>add(Object)</code></a>

(and <code>remove(Object)</code> for the reverse). These may be called
at any time and will update the set of registered instances (firing
result changes as needed).

<pre>
    <font class="keyword">import</FONT> org.openide.util.lookup.*;
    <font class="type">InstanceContent</font> <font class="variable-name">ic</font> = <font class="keyword">new</font> <font class="type">InstanceContent</font> ();
    ic.add(firstObject);
    <font class="keyword">return</font> <font class="keyword">new</font> <font class="type">AbstractLookup</font> (ic);
</pre>

<p>In case it is expensive to actually compute the object in the
lookup, but there is some cheap "key" which can easily generate it,
you may instead register the key by passing in an

<a href="@TOP@org/openide/util/lookup/InstanceContent.Convertor.html"><code>InstanceContent.Convertor</code></a>.

This convertor translates the key to the real instance that the lookup
client sees, if and when needed. For example, if you have a long list
of class names and wish to register default instances of each class,
you might actually register the class name as the key, and supply a
convertor which really loads the class and instantiates it. This makes
it easy to set up the lookup, but nothing is really loaded until
someone asks for it.
