NetBeans uses special extensions to data transfer.

The primary extensions to the
<a href="@JDK@/java/awt/datatransfer/package-summary.html">Java Data Transfer API</a>
are that:

<ul>

<li>The

<a href="ExClipboard.html">clipboard</a>

supports Java Events for content changes.

<li><a href="ExClipboard.Convertor.html">Convertors</a>

may be used to externally add support for additional data flavors to a
transferable.


<li>It is possible to transfer multiple objects (of different types)
at once using a special

<a href="ExTransferable.Multi.html">transfer type</a>.

</ul>
