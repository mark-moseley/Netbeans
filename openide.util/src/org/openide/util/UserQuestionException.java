/** Exception that is thrown when the process is about to perform some
* action that requires user confirmation. It can be useful when there
* is a call to a method which cannot open a dialog, but still would like
* to ask the user a question. It can raise this exception and higher level
* parts of the system can/should catch it and present a dialog to the user
* and if the user agrees reinvoke the action again.
* <P>
* The <code>getLocalizedMessage</code> method should return the user question,
* which will be shown to the user in a dialog with OK, Cancel options and
* if the user chooses OK, method <code>ex.confirmed ()</code> will be called.
