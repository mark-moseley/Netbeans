    <p>
       A web application is an application written for the Internet, including those built with
      Java technologies such as JavaServer Pages and servlets, as well as those built with non-Java
      technologies such as CGI and Perl. Web Applications often include frameworks such as
       JavaServer Faces, Spring, Hibernate, and Struts.    </p>
<p>
       You can create a web application by writing and editing Java source code in the Source Editor. Configure the application
        yourself. Add the JavaServer Faces, Struts, Hibernate, or Spring Web framework to improve the design of your
       application.      </p>
<p>
       A web application roughly corresponds to the J2EE term <i>web application module</i>. This
      is a deployable unit that consists of one or more <a href=
      "../create/about/about_create_webcomps.html">web components</a>, other resources, and <a
      href="../configure/configure_webapp_dd.html">web application deployment descriptors</a>,
      contained in a hierarchy of directories and files in a standard web application format.
