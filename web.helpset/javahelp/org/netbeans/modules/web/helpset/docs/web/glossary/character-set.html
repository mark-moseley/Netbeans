<h6>Character Set</h6>
<p>A character set is a complete group of characters for one or more writing systems. It is more complete than 
an alphabet. It consists of a set of textual and graphic symbols, each of which is mapped to a set of non-negative integers.
The first character set used in computing was ASCII. It is limited in that it can only represent American English. 
Unicode defines a standardized, universal character set that can be extended to accommodate 
additions. </p>
