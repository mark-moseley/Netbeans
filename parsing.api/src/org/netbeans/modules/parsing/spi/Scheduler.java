/**
 * Scheduler defines when tasks should be started. Some {@link SchedulerTask}s (like syntax
 * coloring) are current document sensitive only. It means that such {@link SchedulerTask} 
 * is automatically scheduled when currently edited document is changed.
 * Other tasks may listen on different events. Implementation of Scheduler
 * just listens on various IDE events, and call one of schedule() methods
 * when something interesting happens. Implementation of Parsing API just finds
 * all {@link SchedulerTask}s registerred for this Scheduler and reschedules them.
 * Implementation of this class should be registerred in your manifest.xml file
 * in "Editors/your mime type" folder.
