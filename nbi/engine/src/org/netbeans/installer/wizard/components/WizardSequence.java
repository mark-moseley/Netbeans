/**
 * This class is a specialization of the {@link WizardComponent} which defines 
 * behavior specific to sequences.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A sequence is merely a list of {@link WizardComponent}s which executes when the 
 * sequence itself is executed. This makes wizard sequences the instrument to add
 * "depth" to the wizard, enable conditional execution of a set of components, etc.
 * It is also the only "standard" component which actually makes use of its child 
 * components.
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link WizardSequence} uses child {@link Wizard} instances to execute its 
 * child components. The {@link Wizard} instances are created via the 
 * {@link Wizard#createSubWizard(List,int)} method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A wizard sequence does not have a UI of its own - it completely relies on the UI
 * of its child components.
