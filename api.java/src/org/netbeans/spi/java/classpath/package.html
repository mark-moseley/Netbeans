SPI permitting new classpaths to be constructed and registered.

<p>{@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.ClassPathProvider}s can be registered
to default lookup in order to associate information about classpaths with files.
For example, a Java-oriented project type would normally indicate that its Java
sources have a certain classpath associated with them.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.ClassPathFactory} may be used to
create new {@link org.netbeans.api.java.classpath.ClassPath} instances.</p>
