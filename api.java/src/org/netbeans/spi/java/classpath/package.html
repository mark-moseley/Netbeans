SPI permitting new classpaths to be constructed and registered.

<p>{@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.ClassPathProvider}s can be registered
to default lookup in order to associate information about classpaths with files.
For example, a Java-oriented project type would normally indicate that its Java
sources have a certain classpath associated with them.<br>
For a source file the ClassPathProvider has to return a
{@link org.netbeans.api.java.classpath.ClassPath} of the following ClassPath types:
<ul>
<li>ClassPath.SOURCE - the classpath contains the source roots of the project</li>
<li>ClassPath.BOOT - the classpath contains the jdk runtime libraries</li>
<li>ClassPath.COMPILE - the classpath contains the project compile libraries (compile classpath)</li>
</ul>
it may also return a ClassPath of type ClassPath.EXEC pointing to the build output folder.
<br>
For build output the ClassPathProvider has to return a ClassPath of the following
types:
<ul>
<li>ClassPath.BOOT - the classpath contains the jdk runtime libraries</li>
<li>ClassPath.COMPILE - the classpath contains the project compile libraries (compile classpath)</li>
<li>ClassPath.EXEC - the classpath contains the build output folder</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.ClassPathFactory} may be used to
create new {@link org.netbeans.api.java.classpath.ClassPath} instances.</p>
