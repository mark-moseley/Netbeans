Convenience classes to make it easier to create classpaths.

<p>{@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.support.ClassPathSupport} provides
various ways to create {@link org.netbeans.api.java.classpath.ClassPath} objects
beyond what the plain SPI provides.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.support.PathResourceBase} and
{@link org.netbeans.spi.java.classpath.support.CompositePathResourceBase} can be
used to define parts of a classpath in a controlled way.</p>
