<h1 align="">GUI Form Example Descriptions</h1>
<p>

This project contains three visual forms that were designed with the IDE's
GUI Builder. You can open these forms in the IDE, and you can view accompanying 
demos that show you how those forms can be created in the IDE.
<p><strong>To open an example form in the GUI Builder:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the IDE's Projects window, navigate to the default package node within the <br>
    Source Packages directory.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Double-click the node of the sample form you want to view.
    <p>The IDE launches the GUI Builder and displays the chosen form.
  </li>
</ol>

<br>

<h5>Contact Editor</h5>
<p>This complex form is similar to Windows dialogs typically used to display and edit database information. The example illustrates the full range of GUI Builder features, including alignment, anchoring, sizing, indentation, and runtime auto-resizing behavior. To view a detailed tutorial including flash demonstrations showing how to build this form, see <a href="http://netbeans.org/kb/50/quickstart-gui.html">GUI Building in NetBeans IDE 5.0</a>.</p>

<br>

<h5>Antenna Preferences</h5>
<p>This example illustrates a type of table-based form commonly used to display related information in visually coherent groups. The GUI Builder's advanced alignment features enable you to group and size non-adjacent components (such as labels, textfields, and buttons) consistently without the need to merge cells manually. To view a flash demonstration showing how to build this form, see <a href="http://netbeans.org/kb/50/gui_sample_project/antenna_form.html">GUI Form Example: Antenna Preferences Dialog</a>.</p>

<br>

<h5>Find</h5>
<p>This simple form illustrates a straight-forward layout often used in various applications requiring basic search functionality. The GUI Builder's alignment and sizing features enable you to quickly construct such forms while ensuring that they localize predictably.
