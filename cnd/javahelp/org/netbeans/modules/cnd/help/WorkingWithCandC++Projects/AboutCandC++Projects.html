    <p>
       A C or C++ project is a group of C or C++ source files, and the settings with which you
      build, run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all development has to take place
      within a project.
    </p>
    <p>
       The IDE stores all of the information about your C or C++ project in makefiles, a properties
      file, and a few XML configuration files. You can build and run your projects outside the IDE
      exactly the same as inside the IDE.
    </p>
    <p>
       The NetBeans C/C++ Pack provides the following project templates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        C/C++ Project With Existing Sources
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Application
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Dynamic Library
      </li>
      <li>
        C/C++ Static Library
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       With a C/C++ Project With Existing Sources, the IDE relies on your existing makefile for
      instructions on how to compile and run your application. The settings you specify in the New
      Project wizard as well as in the Project Properties dialog box are used to tell the IDE how
      your makefile manages your source code and must be consistent with the settings in your
      makefile.
    </p>
    <p>
       With a C/C++ Application, Dynamic Library, or Static Library project, the IDE controls all
      aspects of how your application is built, run, and debugged. You specify project settings
      when creating the project and in the Project Properties dialog box. The IDE generates a
      makefile in which all of your settings are stored.
