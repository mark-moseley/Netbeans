<h2>About C and C++ Projects
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>A C or C++ project is a group of C or C++ source files, and the settings with 
which you build,  
run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all development has to take place 
within a project. 
</p>
<p>
The IDE stores all of the information about your C or C++ project in makefiles, a 
properties file, and a few XML configuration files. You can build and run your projects outside the IDE exactly the same as inside the IDE.
</p>
<p>The NetBeans C/C++ Development Pack provides the following project templates:
<ul>
<li>C/C++ Project From Existing Code</li>
<li>C/C++ Application</li>
<li>C/C++ Dynamic Library</li>
<li>C/C++ Static Library</li>
</ul>
<p>
With a C/C++ Project From Existing Code, the IDE relies on your 
existing makefile for instructions on how to compile and run your application. 
The settings you specify in the New Project wizard as well as in the Project 
Properties dialog box are used to tell the IDE how your makefile manages your source 
code and must be consistent with the settings in your makefile.
</p>
<p>With a C/C++ Application, Dynamic Library, or Static Library project, the 
IDE controls all aspects 
of how your application is built, run, and debugged. You specify project settings  
when creating the project and in the Project Properties dialog box. The IDE 
generates a makefile in which all of your settings are stored.
