<h2>Doing Remote Development</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>You can build, run, and debug projects on the local host (the system from which 
you started the IDE) or on a remote host running a UNIX&reg; operating system.
</p>
<p>You can define remote development hosts in the Build Tools tab of the 
<a href="../CandC++ProjectBasics/CandC++Options.html">Options window</a>. A remote development 
host contains the system name of the host, a login name, and a password.
</p> 
<p>To develop a project on a 
remote host, the project must be on a shared filesystem that is visible 
on both the local host and the remote host. Typically such a filesystem 
is shared using NFS or Samba. You can define the mapping between local and 
remote paths to project source files when you define the remote host.
</p>
<p>When you create a project, the current development is selected 
as the development host for the project. You can change the 
development host for the project on the Build panel of the Project Properties 
dialog box.
