<h2>Resolve Missing Native Build Tools Dialog Box</h2>
<p>If the tools required to build the project are not in the compiler 
collection specified for the project, the 
Resolve Missing Native Build Tools> dialog box opens.</p>
<p>
To resolve the missing build tools, you can set the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Current Path.</b> The path list used by the IDE to locate 
the build tools required by your projects. You can add or remove paths from the list, or 
reorder the list by moving paths up or down. 
</li>
<li><b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use when building 
projects. The default command is the first make command found in the 
current path. If you change the command, the current path is searched for 
the new command. Clicking Version displays the version of the make 
command.</li>
<li><b>Gdb Command.</b> The gbd command to use when debugging projects. 
The default command is the first gdb command found in the current path. 
If you change the command, the current path is searched for 
the new command. Clicking Version displays the version of the make 
command.</li>
<li><b>Compiler Collection.</b> The compiler collection to use for 
building projects. The drop-down list includes a compiler collection for 
each directory in the current path that ocntains compilers.</li>
<li><b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the selected compiler 
collection. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
<li><b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the selected compiler 
collection. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
