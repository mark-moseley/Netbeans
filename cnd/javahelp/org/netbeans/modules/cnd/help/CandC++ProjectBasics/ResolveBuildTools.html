<h2>Resolve Missing Native Build Tools Dialog Box</h2>
<i>This needs to be fixed.</i>
<p>If the tools required to build the project are not in the  
collection specified for the project, the 
Resolve Missing Native Build Tools dialog box opens.</p>
<p>
To resolve the missing build tools, you can set the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Development Host.</b> The Development Host drop-down list includes 
your local host and any remote hosts you have defined. For information 
on using remote hosts, see <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote Development</a>.
You can add and remove 
remote development hosts, change the default host, and share project sources 
on the local host with the remote host.
<ul>
<li>To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager 
dialog box, click Add. In the Add New Server dialog box, type the 
name of the host in the Development Server field. Change 
the default Login name if needed. Type your password 
in the Password field and click OK.
</li>
<li>To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager 
dialog box, select the host you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
</li>
<li>To set a host as the default development host, select the host 
from the Development Host drop-down list.
</li>
<li>To map the project sources on the local host to a remote host, 
click Path Mapper. In the Edit Path's Map dialog box, select the 
remote host in the Host drop-down list. For each mapping, type 
the local path to project sources in the Local Path field and the 
corresponding remote path in the Remote Path field. 
</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays 
the collections found on the current development host and the local 
host. The default  
collection is listed in bold type. For the local host, you can modify the list by adding or removing collections.</li>
<ul>
<li>To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the 
base directory in the Add New Tool Set dialog box. The Tool Set 
Family and Tool Set Name are filled in automatically. You can specify
a different name for the collection. If you change the family,  
make sure that the family you specify is the correct family for the 
collection or the compiler flags might not be valid. 
</li>
<li>To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and 
click Remove.
</li>
<li>To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list 
and modify the base directory, tool set family, or tool set name in
the dialog box.
</li>
<li>To make a collection the default, select the collection and 
click Default.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory for compilers for 
the current development host. These fields can be edited for the local host 
but not for remote hosts.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the base directory. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
<li><b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the selected compiler 
collection. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
<li><b>Fortran Compiler.</b> The Fortran compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the base directory. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use for building 
projects. The default command is the first one found in the 
base directory. To select a different command from the base directory 
or another directory, click the browse button and navigate to a different 
command in the Select Tool dialog box.
</li>
<li><b>Debugger Command.</b> The gdb command to use when debugging 
projects. The default command is the first one found in the 
base directory. To select a different command from the base directory 
or another directory, click the browse button and navigate to a different 
command in the Select Tool dialog box. 
</li>
</ul>
