<h2>Resolve Missing Native Build Tools Dialog Box</h2>
<p>If the tools required to build the project are not in the compiler 
collection specified for the project, the 
Resolve Missing Native Build Tools dialog box opens.</p>
<p>
To resolve the missing build tools, you can set the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays 
the collections found in your environment the first time you started 
the IDE, plus any collection you have added. The default 
collection is listed in bold type. 
<ul>
<li>To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the 
base directory in the Add New Tool Set dialog box. The Tool Set 
Family and Tool Set Name are filled in automatically. You can specify
a different name for the collection. If you change the family,  
make sure that the family you specify is the correct family for the 
collection or the compiler flags might not be valid. 
</li>
<li>To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and 
click Remove.
</li>
<li>To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list 
and modify the base directory, tool set family, or tool set name in
the dialog box.
</li>
<li>To make a collection the default, select the collection and 
click Default.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory for compilers.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the base directory. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
<li><b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the selected compiler 
collection. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use for building 
projects. The default command is the first one found in the 
base directory. To select a different command from the base directory 
or another directory, click the browse button and navigate to a different 
command in the Select Tool dialog box.
</li>
<li><b>Debugger Command.</b> The gdb command to use when debugging 
projects. The default command is the first one found in the 
base directory. To select a different command from the base directory 
or another directory, click the browse button and navigate to a different 
command in the Select Tool dialog box. 
</li>
</ul>
