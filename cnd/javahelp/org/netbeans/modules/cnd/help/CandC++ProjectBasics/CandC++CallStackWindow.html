<h2>C and C++ Call Stack Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
The Call Stack window lists the sequence of function calls made during 
execution of the current thread. By default, the Call Stack window 
opens automatically whenever you start a debugging session.
You can open the Call Stack window by by choosing Window &gt; 
Debugging &gt; Call Stack.
</p>
<p>
If you open the Call Stack window when a debugging session is 
running, it closes automatically when you end the debugging session.
If you open the window when no debugging session is running, it 
stays open until you close it.
</p>
<p>
The information given for each call includes the name of the function, 
followed by the filename and line number of the function's currently
executing statement. If the filename and line number are displayed 
in blue underlined text, then the text is linked to the source code
for that function.
</p>
The initial function, <tt>main()</tt> for C and C++ programs, is at the
bottom of the Call Stack window. The function executing when the 
program stopped is at the top of the window. This function is known 
as the stopped-in function.
</p>
<p>One call is the current call. By default, this call is the most 
recent call made by the current thread. When you select a different 
current thread, the Call Stack window is updated to show the calls 
for that thread and the values of variables in the Local Variables 
window are adjusted for the context of the current call.
</p>

The following table describes the icons displayed to the left of the 
call name.
