<h2>Options Window: C/C++
</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The C/C++ panel of the Options window lets you configure build tools, project 
settings, and code assistance settings for your C and C++ projects. You can 
access this panel by choosing Tools &gt; Options and clicking the C/C++ 
category.
<h3>Build Tools tab</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Current Path.</b> The path list used by the IDE to locate 
the build tools required by your projects. You can add or remove paths from the list, or 
reorder the list by moving paths up or down. 
</li>
<li><b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use when building 
projects. The default command is the first make command found in the 
current path. If you change the command, the current path is searched for 
the new command. Clicking Version displays the version of the make 
command.</li>
<li><b>Gdb Command.</b> The gbd command to use when debugging projects. 
The default command is the first gdb command found in the current path. 
If you change the command, the current path is searched for 
the new command. Clicking Version displays the version of the make 
command.</li>
<li><b>Compiler Collection.</b> The compiler collection to use for 
building projects. The drop-down list includes a compiler collection for 
each directory in the current path that ocntains compilers.</li>
<li><b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the selected compiler 
collection. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
<li><b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler to use for building projects. 
The default compiler is the first one found in the selected compiler 
collection. You can select a compiler from the drop-down list, or select 
Add from the list to add another compiler from the same directory.</li>
<li><b>Required Tools.</b> The tools required to build projects.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project Options Tab</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Default Platform.</b> The default platform to use when 
creating new projects. You do not usually have to change this property.</li>
<li><b>Make Options.</b> Global options for the <tt>make</tt> command.</li>
<li><b>File Path Mode.</b> The mode for storing file paths in a project. 
Always Relative mode stores paths as relative to project root. 
Always Absolute mode stores paths as absolute paths. Auto mode 
stores paths as relative to project root if inside project, 
othervise as absolute path.</li>
<li><b>Save All Modified Files Before Running Make.</b> If selected, 
saves all unsaved files in the IDE before running make. It is 
recommended to leave this property selected because modifications 
to files in the IDE are not recognized by make unless they are 
first saved to disk.</li>
<li><b>Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes.</b> If selected, 
writes make output to a single Output window tab, deleting the 
output from the previous process. If not selected, opens a new tab 
for each make process.</li>
<li><b>Enable dependency checking in generated makefiles.</b> Add 
<tt>make state</tt> statements to the makefile.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code Assistance Tab</h3>
<p>
Select the appropriate compiler tab. Modify the settings for include files 
and macro definitions that are used by the built-in parser.
</p>
<h3>Formatting Style Tab</h3>
<p>Select the language from the Language drop-down list and the 
style from the Style Name list. Modify the style property settings.
