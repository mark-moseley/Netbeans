       The C/C++ panel of the Options window lets you configure build tools, project settings, code
      assistance settings, formatting style, semantic highlighting settings, and accepted file
      extensions for your C and C++ projects. You can access this panel by choosing Tools &gt;
      Options and clicking the C/C++ category.

    <h3>
       Build Tools tab
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Development Host list includes your local host and any remote hosts you have defined.
        You can add and remove remote development hosts, change the default host, and specify how
        to share project sources on the local host with the remote host. For information on using
        remote hosts, see <a href="../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote
        Development</a>. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, click
            Add. The New Remote Development Host wizard starts. See the help for the <a href=
            "NewRemoteDevelopmentHostWizardP1.html">New Remote Development Host wizard</a> for more
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            To set a host as the default development host, click Edit. In the Development Host
            Manager dialog box, select the host, click Set as Default, then click OK.
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, select
            the host you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
          </li>
          <li>
            To map shared project sources on the local host to a remote host, click Edit. In the
            Development Host Manager dialog box, click Path Mapper. In the Edit Path's Map dialog
            box, select the remote host in the Host list. For each mapping, in the Local Path
            field, type the path used to access the shared project sources from the local host. In
            the Remote Path field, type the path used to access the shared project sources from the
            remote host.
          </li>
          <li>
            To change IDE properties related to the remote development host, click Properties. In
            the Host Properties dialog box, you can change the name displayed in the IDE for the
            host by typing in the Name field. To change the way project files are shared with the
            remote host, select the file synchronization method in the Synchronization list. If the
            project files are in a shared folder accessible from the local host and remote host,
            select File System Sharing. If sharing the files is not possible, select rsync to use
            the rsync utility to copy files to the remote host, or scp to use the secure copy
            command to copy the files. The files are copied to your .netbeans directory by default.
            This can be changed with the Path Mapper.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays the collections found on the
        currently selected development host. The default collection for that selected host is
        listed in bold type. You can modify the tool collection list by adding or removing
        collections. Be sure to select the Development Host before you modify any information about
        the tool collection.
      </li>
      <li>
        To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the base directory in the Add New
        Tool Set dialog box. The Tool Set Family and Tool Set Name are filled in automatically. You
        can specify a different name for the collection. If you change the family, make sure that
        the family you specify is the correct family for the collection or the compiler flags might
        not be valid.
      </li>
      <li>
        To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and click Remove.
      </li>
      <li>
        To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list and modify the base
        directory, tool set family, or tool set name in the dialog box.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make a collection the default, select the collection and click Default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Base Directory.</b> The base directory for compilers for the current development host.
        The path can be edited for the local host or remote hosts, but browsing to select a
        different path only works on the local host.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>C Compiler.</b> The C compiler to use for building projects. The default compiler is the
        first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a compiler, or
        click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>C++ Compiler.</b> The C++ compiler to use for building projects. The default compiler is
        the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a compiler, or
        click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fortran Compiler.</b> The Fortran compiler to use for building projects. The default
        compiler is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a
        compiler, or click the browse button to navigate to a different compiler on the local host.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assembler.</b> The assembler utility to use to translate assembly language projects into
        machine code. The default assembler, if any, is the first one found in the base directory.
        You can type a different path to a compiler, or click the browse button to navigate to a
        different assembler on the local host.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make Command.</b> The make command to use for building projects. The default command is
        the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a make command,
        or click the browse button and navigate to a different command on the local host.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Debugger Command.</b> The gdb command to use when debugging projects. The default
        command is the first one found in the base directory. You can type a different path to a
        gdb command, or click the browse button and navigate to a different command on the local
        host.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
       Project Options Tab
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Make Options.</b> Global options for the <tt>make</tt> command.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>File Path Mode.</b> The mode for storing file paths in a project. Always Relative mode
        stores paths as relative to the project root. Always Absolute mode stores paths as absolute
        paths. Auto mode stores paths as relative to the project root if inside the project,
        otherwise as absolute path.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Save All Modified Files Before Running Make.</b> If selected, saves all unsaved files in
        the IDE before running make. It is recommended to leave this property selected because
        modifications to files in the IDE are not recognized by make unless they are first saved to
        disk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes.</b> If selected, writes make output to a
        single Output window tab, deleting the output from the previous process. If not selected,
        opens a new tab for each make process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Enable dependency checking in generated makefiles.</b> Add <tt>make state</tt>
        statements to the makefile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Show binary files in Projects view.</b> If selected, the Projects view shows all files
        in a directory tree, including binary objects. This option is most relevant to projects
        created with existing sources, which might place sources and binaries in the same location.
        Deselect this option to more easily see your C/C++ source files and header files.
      </li>

    <h3>
       Semantic Highlighting Tab
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Mark Occurrences of Symbol Under Caret.</b> If this option is selected, then when you
        click on a class, function, variable, or macro, all occurrences of that class, function,
        variable, or macro in the current file are highlighted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Keep Marks.</b> If this option is selected, highlighted classes, functions, variable,
        and macros remain highlighted.
