       The C/C++ panel of the Options window lets you configure build tools, project settings, code
      assistance settings, formatting style, semantic highlighting settings, and accepted file
      extensions for your C and C++ projects. You can access this panel by choosing Tools &gt;
      Options and clicking the C/C++ category.

    <ul>
        <li>
    <p>The Development Host list includes your local host and any remote
        hosts you have defined. You can add and remove remote development hosts, change the default
        host, and specify how to share project sources on the local host with the remote host. For
        information on using remote hosts, see <a href=
        "../WorkingWithCandC++Projects/RemoteDevelopment.html">Remote Development</a>. 
       </p>
       <ul>
          <li>
            To add a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, click
            Add. The New Remote Development Host wizard starts. See the <a href=
            "NewRemoteDevelopmentHostWizardP1.html">help for the New Remote Development Host
            wizard</a> for more information.
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove a remote host, click Edit. In the Development Host Manager dialog box, select
            the host you want to remove, click Remove, then click OK.
          </li>
          <li>
            To set a host as the default development host, select the host from the Development
            Host drop-down list.
          </li>
          <li>
            To map the project sources on the local host to a remote host, click Path Mapper. In
            the Edit Path's Map dialog box, select the remote host in the Host drop-down list. For
            each mapping, type the local path to project sources in the Local Path field and the
            corresponding remote path in the Remote Path field.

        <b>Tool Collection.</b> The tool collection list displays the collections found on the
        currently selected development host. The default collection for that selected host is
        listed in bold type. You can modify the tool collection list by adding or removing
        collections. Be sure to select the Development Host before you modify any information about
        the tool collection. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            To add a collection to the list, click Add and specify the base directory in the Add
            New Tool Set dialog box. The Tool Set Family and Tool Set Name are filled in
            automatically. You can specify a different name for the collection. If you change the
            family, make sure that the family you specify is the correct family for the collection
            or the compiler flags might not be valid.
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove a collection from the list, select the collection and click Remove.
          </li>
          <li>
            To duplicate a collection, select the collection from the list and modify the base
            directory, tool set family, or tool set name in the dialog box.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make a collection the default, select the collection and click Default.

      <li>
        <b>Save All Modified Files Before Running Make.</b> If selected, saves all unsaved files in

      <li>
        <b>Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes.</b> If selected, writes make output to a
