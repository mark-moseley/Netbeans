<h2>Attaching the Debugger to a Running Process</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>
If you want to debug a program that is already running, you can 
attach the debugger to the appropriate process.
</p>
<p>
You might want to attach the debugger to a running process under 
the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>
To debug a running server without stopping or killing it
</li>
<li>
To debug a running GUI program without restarting it
</li>
<li>To debug a program that is looping indefinitely without 
killing it
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>To attach the debugger to a running process:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Run &gt; Attach Debugger.
<p>The Attach dialog box opens displaying a list of all of your 
currently active processes.
</p>
</li>
<li>If you want to filter the list of processes, type the string 
you want to match in the Filter text box.
</li>
<li>Select the process to which you want to attach the debugger.
</li>
<li>The Project drop-down list includes all open projects. 
The IDE can display source files for the process 
to which you are attaching only if a project exists for that 
program. From the drop-down list, select the project that 
represents the program to which you are attaching. If the selected 
project does not match the program to which you are attaching, the 
attach is aborted.
</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>
