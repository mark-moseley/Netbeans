<h2>New Watch Dialog Box</h2>
<p>The New Watch dialog box lets you specify variables or expressions 
to watch continuously when debugging an application. You open this 
dialog box either by choosing Run > New Watch or by right-clicking a 
variable in the Source Editor and choosing New Watch. When you open 
the dialog box from the Source Editor, the Watch Expression field 
contains the name of the variable that the insertion point is on.
</p>
<p>
When you specify an expression to watch, follow the syntax rules of 
the debugger that you are using, which by default is the gdb debugger.
</p>
<p>
When you create a watch, the value of the variable or expression is 
immediately evaluated and displayed in the Watches window. The 
value is based on the current context. When you change the current
context, the Watches window is updated to show the value of the 
watch for that context.
