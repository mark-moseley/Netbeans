<h2>Using the C or C++ Call Stack
</h2>

</p>
<p>
The call stack represents all currently active routines&#45;&#45;those that have
been called but have not yet returned to their respective caller. In the
stack, the functions and their arguments are listed in the order in which
they were called.
</p>
<p>
The initial function, <tt>main()</tt> for C and C++ programs, is at 
the bottom of the Call Stack window. The function executing when
the program stopped is at the top of the Call Stack window. This function is
known as the stopped-in function.
</p>
<p>The information given for each call in the stack includes the function 
name, followed by the file name and line number of the currently executing 
statement. 
</p>
<p>
You can open the Call Stack window at any time by choosing Window &gt; 
Debugging &gt; Call Stack (Alt-Shift-3).
</p>
<p><b>To browse the call stack, do any of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>To move up the stack (toward <tt>main()</tt>), choose Debug &gt; 
Stack &gt; Make Caller Current (Ctrl-Alt-down arrow).
</li>
<li>To move down the stack, choose Debug &gt; Stack &gt; Make Callee 
Current (Ctrl-Alt-up arrow).
</li>
<li>To make a call current, double-click the call in the Call Stack window.
</li>
</ul>
