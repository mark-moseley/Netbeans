<h2>Using the Include Window</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p> 
<p>The Include Hierarchy window lets you inspect all header and source files that are directly 
or indirectly included in a source file, or all source and header files that 
directly or indirectly include a header file.</p>
<p>You can open the Include Hierarchy window as pop-up window or as a window in 
the IDE. If you open the Include Hierarchy window in the IDE when the 
Type Hierarchy window is open, the Include Hierarchy window replaces 
the Type Hierarchy window.</p>
<p><b>To list all the header and source files 
included in a source file, or all the source and header files that include a
header file:</b>
<ol>
<li>In the Source Editor, right-click in the source file or header file.</li>
<li>To display the include hierarchy in a window in the IDE, choose 
View Include Hierarchy. The Include window opens to the right of 
Source Editor window.</li>
<li>To display the include hierarchy in a pop-up window, choose 
Inspect Include Hierarchy. The pop-up Include window opens.
</li>
</ol>
For a source file, the default hierarchy display is a plain list of all directly 
and indirectly included files. For a header file, the default hierarchy display is a plain list of files 
that directly include the header file.</p>
<p><b>To list all of the source and header files that directly or indirectly include 
the same included file:</b>
<ol>
<li>In the Source Editor, right-click in an include directive in a 
source or header file.
<li>To display the list of including files in a window in the IDE, choose 
View Include Hierarchy. The Include window opens to the right of 
Source Editor window.</li>
<li>To display the list of including files in a pop-up window, choose 
Inspect Include Hierarchy. The pop-up Include window opens.
</li>
</ol>
By default, the include hierarchy is displayed as a plain list of 
the files that directly or indirectly include the header file.
</p>
<p>Buttons at the bottom of the Include Hierarchy window allow you to 
change the display:
<ul>
<li><b>Refresh button.</b>(IDE window only) Updates the hierarchy display.</li>
<li><b>Who Includes This File button.</b> Changes the list to the files
that include the file (the default view for header files).</li>
<li><b>Who Is Included in the File button.</b> Changes the list to the 
files that are included in the file (the default view for source files).</li>
<li><b>Recursive Include button.</b> Changes the list from only files that directly 
include or are included to all files that include or are included.</li>
<li><b>Direct Only Include button.</b> Changes the list from all files that 
include or are include to only files that directly include or are included.</li>
<li><b>Tree View button.</b> Changes the plain list to a 
tree view.</li>
<li><b>Plain List button.</b> Changes the tree view to a 
plain list.</li>
