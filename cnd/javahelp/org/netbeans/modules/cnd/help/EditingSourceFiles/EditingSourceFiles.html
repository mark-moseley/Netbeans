<h2>Editing C and C++ Source Files</h2>
<p>
The IDE's built-in Source Editor enables you to view, create, and 
edit your C and C++ source code. You can open the Source Editor window by 
double-clicking an editable element in the Projects window or by 
choosing File > New to create a new file.
</p>
<p>
The IDE has many features to simplify coding of C and C++ files 
such as:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="UsingCodeCompletion.html">Code completion</a></b>. 
A code completion box displays possible 
ways of completing the expression you are typing.
</li>
<li><b><a href="UsingAbbreviations.html">Code templates</a></b>. 
You can enter common code snippets by 
typing abbreviations for those snippets. You can use built-in 
code templates and also create your 
own code templates.
</li>
<li>
<b><a href="CandC++CodeFolding.html">Code Folding</a></b>. Enables you to hide sections of code, such as 
declaration blocks and method bodies.
</li>
<li><b><a href="UsingPairCompletion.html">Pair Completion, Smart 
Enter, and Smart Semicolons</a></b>. When you type a 
quotation mark, bracket, brace, or parenthesis, the Source Editor 
automatically inserts the closing character. The matching is 
"smart", so the closing characters are not duplicated if you type 
them yourself.
</li>
<li><b><a href="UsingClassView.html">Classes Window</a></b>. Lets you 
view all of the classes in your project and their members and fields.
</li>
<li><b><a href="IncludeView.html">Include Hierarchy Window</a></b>. 
Lets you inspect all header and source files that are directly 
or indirectly included in a source file, or all source and header files that 
directly or indirectly include a header file.
</li>
<li><b><a href="TypeView.html">Type Hierachy Window</a></b> Lets you inspect all subtypes or supertypes of a 
class.</li>
<li><b><a href="UsingNavigator.html">Navigator Window</a></b>. 
Provides a compact view of the file that is currently 
selected, and simplifies navigation between different 
parts of the file.</li>
<li><b><a href="UsingHyperlinks.html">Hyperlinks</a></b>. Let you jump 
from the invocation of a class, method, variable, or constant to its 
declaration. You can also jump from a function call to the function definition, 
from a function definition to the function declaration, and from a function 
declaration to the function definition.</li>
</ul>
