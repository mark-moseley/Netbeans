<h2>
Error Highlighting</h2>
<p>The Source Editor highlights syntax and semantic errors, such as missing semicolons 
and unresolved identifiers, in your source code when you do one of the 
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type in new code</li>
<li>Edit existing code</li>
<li>Add an existing file to your project</li>
<li>Move a file to a different location in your project</li>
<li>Change the properties of the project or one of its source files</li>
</ul>
<p>Errors are underlined in red and a glyph <img src=../images/error-glyph.png" alt="Error glyph"> 
&nbsp;is displayed in the left 
margin of the editor window next to each line that contains an error. 
An error message is displayed when you mouse over the glyph.</p>
<p>If there are any errors in a file, red marks are displayed in the 
error stripe on the right side of the editor window. The error stripe 
represents the whole file, not just the lines currently displayed. Double-click 
a mark in th error stripe to jump to the line the mark represents.
