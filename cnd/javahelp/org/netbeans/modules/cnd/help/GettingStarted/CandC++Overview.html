<h2>C and C++ Development Overview</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The following windows and tools are central to performing your daily 
C and C++ development tasks in the IDE:
<ul>
<li><a href="#Projects">Projects window</a></li>
<li><a href="#Files">Files window</a></li>
<li><a href="#Navigator">Navigator window</a></li>
<li><a href="#Classes">Classes window</a></li>
<li><a href="#Editor">Source Editor window</a></li>
<li><a href="#Compilers">Compilers</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Projects Window<a name="Projects"></a></h3>
The <a href="ProjectsWindow.html">Projects window</a> is the main 
entry point to your project sources. It shows a logical view of 
important project contents such as source files, header files, and 
makefiles. You can right-click any project node to access a 
contextual menu of commands for building and running, as well as to 
open the Project Properties dialog box.
</p>
<h3>Files Window<a name="Files"></a></h3>
<p>
The <a href="FilesWindow.html">Files window</a> shows a directory-based view of your projects, including files 
and folders that are not displayed in the Projects window. From the Files window, 
you can open and edit your project configuration files, like the project build 
script and properties file. You can also view build outputs like object (<tt>.o</tt>) 
files and executable (<tt>.exe</tt>) files.
</p>
<h3>Navigator Window<a name="Navigator"></a></h3>
<p>
The Navigator window is a tool that displays information about 
C or C++ source files in the currently open project. By default, 
the Navigator window is located in the lower lefthand corner of the 
IDE's workspace below the Projects and Files windows.
</p>
<h3>Classes Window<a name="Classes"></a></h3>
<p>
The Classes window lets you see all of the classes in your C++ project, and the 
members and fields for each class. By default, the Classes window is located 
in the same section of the IDE's workspace as the Projects and Files windows.
</p>
<h3>Source Editor Window<a name="Editor"></a></h3>
<p>
The Source Editor is a full-featured text editor that is integrated with the 
Projects window and the compilers. The Source Editor is automatically 
opened when a new and editable object is created from the available templates in 
the IDE. It can also be opened by double-clicking the node of an editable object 
in the Projects window.
</p>
<h3>Compilers<a name="Compilers"></a></h3>
<p>
The Build menu contains commands for compiling applications. You can compile an 
entire project or compile single files. You can also access the most common 
compiling actions by using the commands in the Build toolbar or by using the 
keyboard equivalents.
