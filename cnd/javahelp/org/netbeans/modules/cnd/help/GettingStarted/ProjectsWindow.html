<h2>Projects Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>The Projects window is the main entry point to your projects. It shows 
logical view of important project contents. You can open the Projects window by
choosing Window &gt; Projects (Ctrl-1).</p>
<p>You can view all of your project contents in a directory-based view in the 
<a href="FilesWindow.html">Files window</a>. To open the Files window, choose Window 
&gt; Files (Ctrl-2).
</p>
<h3>Logical Folders</h3>
<p>A C or C++ Application or Library project is created with four logical folders, which are displayed in the Projects window:
<ul>
<li>Source Files</li>
<li>Header Files</li>
<li>Resource Files</li>
<li>Important Files</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>A C or C++ Project with an Existing Makefile is created with one logical folder, 
Important Files.</p>
<p>
A logical folder is not a directory. It is a way for you to organize your files, 
and does not reflect where the files are physically stored. Files added to the Source 
Files folder, Header Files folder, and other logical 
folders are automatically part of a project and are compiled when you build the 
project. 
</p>
<p>Files added to the Important Files folder are not part of the project and are not 
compiled when you build the project. These files are just for reference and are convenient 
for projects with existing makefiles.
</p>
<h3>Project Icons</h3>
<p>
The following icon is used for C and C++ projects in the 
Projects window.
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" summary="The left column lists  
the icon. The right column lists the description.">
<tr valign="top">
<th scope="col" align="left">Icon</th>
<th scope="col" align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="../images/makeProject.gif">
</td>
<td>C/C++ Application Project<br>
C/C++ Dynamic Library Project<br>
C/C++ Static Library Project<br>
C/C++ Project with Existing Makefile
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Main Project</h3>
<p>Whenever you have multiple projects open, one project should always be set as
the main project. The IDE provides shortcut commands to quickly build and run the 
main project.
</p>
<p>
In the Projects window, the main project is shown in bold. You can set any project 
as the main project by right-clicking its project icon and choosing 
Set Main Project.
</p>
<h3>Pop-up Menu</h3>
<p>Each node in the Projects window has a pop-up menu of commands that you can 
run on that node. You open a node's pop-up menu by right-clicking the node. The 
pop-up menu for project nodes contains all of the major project commands, like 
Build and Run. The pop-up menu also contains a Properties command, which you can use 
to configure your project.
