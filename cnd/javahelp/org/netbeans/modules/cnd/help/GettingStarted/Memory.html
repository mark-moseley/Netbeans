<title>Memory Requirements</title>

<h2>Memory Requirements</h2>
<p>
The NetBeans IDE has a default heap size of 128 MB. This heap size is adequate 
if you are using NetBeans C/C++ Development Pack to develop small applications 
with up to 100 source files. If you are 
developing applications 
with more than 100 source files,
you need to increase the heap size or  
you might get out of memory exceptions from the built-in parser.
</p>
<p>
You can set the heap size for the JVM 
on which the NetBeans IDE runs in the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> 
file. 
<p><b>To change the heap size:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> from the <tt>etc</tt> 
folder in the NetBeans 
installation directory
into the <tt>etc</tt> directory in your NetBeans user directory (<tt>$HOME/.netbeans/5.5/etc</tt>).
You might need to create the <tt>etc</tt> directory.
</li>
<li>In the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> file in your user
directory, edit the <tt>-J-Xmx</tt> 
command line Java startup switch (bolded below) in the <tt>netbeans.conf</tt> file, 
and then restart the IDE. 
<pre>
# command line switches
netbeans_default_options="-J-Xms32m <b>-J-Xmx128m</b> -J-XX:PermSize=32m 
-J-XX:MaxPermSize=96m -J-Xverify:none -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true"
</pre></li>
</ol><p>
The recommended heap sizes for NetBeans C/C++ 
Development Pack for medium-sized and large applications are:
<ul>
<li>For developing medium-sized applications (100-2000 
source files) on a system with one CPU and 1 GB of RAM: 512 MB</li>
<li>For developing large applications (more than 2000 source files) on a system with 
one or multiple CPUS and 2 GB of RAM): 1.5 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>To insure that you do not run out of memory while the built-in parser is 
running, you can also add the garbage collector switches <tt>-J-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC</tt>
(concurrent collector) and <tt>-J-XX:+UseParNewGC</tt> (parallel collector) to the 
<tt>netbeans.conf</tt> file.
