# InvalidUrlBase=The URL you have specified is invalid. It should contain a single {0} in the URL\nwhere the current identifier will be inserted. For example, use\n
# http://docs.sun.com/ab2/coll.40.6/@Ab2CollView?Ab2&DwebQuery={0}

To provide a URL to a man page web site, choose Tools > Options.\n\
Expand Editing and then expand Editor Settings. Select C and C++ Editor and type\n\
the URL in the Documentation URL base text field.\n\
\n\
Note that the IDE replaces {0} with the word that is under the cursor\n\
when you choose Show Documentation from the contextual menu. For example\n\
if your Documentation URL base is the following, and the cursor is over\n\
the word fopen,\n\
\n\
    http://your.search.engine.here.com/search?topic=man+{0}\n\
\n\
the IDE uses the following URL:\n\
\n\
    http://your.search.engine.here.com/search?topic=man+fopen\n\
\n\
Note: There are several programs available from the web, such as\n\
man2html, that dynamically create HTML for man page requests. If you\n\
have a server that dynamically creates HTML, place a URL similar to the\n\
following in the Documentation URL base text field:\n\
\n\
    http://localhost/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=all&topic={0}
