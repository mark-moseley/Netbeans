1. Create a file and commit it to CVS.
2. Now remove this file from CVS. It now only 
exists in the "Attic" and is not displayed in the 
explorer.
3. Create a local copy of this file again. The 
status displayed will be "Local".
4. Do a "cvs refresh" on this file. That status 
will change to "Up-to-date, No".

To get this file into CVS again, have to do 
a "cvs add" first. But this option is now not 
available in the context menu and is dimmed in 
the task bar.

Well, "cvs status" for that file says that it's "Up-to-date"! This
seems to be a bug in javacvs library, because cvs binary says that
it's "Unknown".
