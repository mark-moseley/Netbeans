        <h2>Attach Wizard: Select Target Type</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The Attach Wizard helps you configure the settings for profiling an application using the attach method.
        In most cases you only need to use the Attach wizard to profile an application running on a remote JVM.
        If your application is running on a local JVM and you can start the application from the IDE, 
        you can use Profile Main Project.</p>
        
        <p>You use this page of the Attach wizard to specify the type of application you want to profile and how
        you want to attach to the application. After specifying the attach settings, click Next to review the attach settings.</p>
        
        <p>In this page of the wizard you specify the following settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Target Type.</b> Select the type of project that you want to profile.
            You can select from following types:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Application.</b> Select this if your project is a standalone J2SE application.</li>
                <li><b>Applet.</b> Select this if your project is an applet.</li>            
                <li><b>Java EE Web/App Server.</b> Select this if you are profiling an enterprise application or web application deployed to a web or application server.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>If you select Java EE Web/App Server, you also need to specify the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Java EE Web/Application Server Type.</b> Select the deployment server for the application</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        
        <li><b>Attach method.</b> Select an attach method according to the machine where the application is running.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Local.</b> Select Local if your application is running on the same machine as the IDE.</li>
                <li><b>Remote.</b> Select Remote if the application is running on a remote machine.</li>
            </ul></li>
        
            <li><b>Attach invocation.</b> Select the type of attach method.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Direct.</b> Select Direct if you want to profile application startup.
                When you choose this option, the application startup is paused until the IDE is attached to the application/JVM. </li>
                <li><b>Dynamic.</b> Select Dynamic if you want to attach and reattach the IDE.
                When you choose this option, the application is started normally. You can then attach, detach and reattach to the
                application without restarting the application.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
            <ul class="note">
                <li>The Dynamic attach method requires that the target application is running on JDK 1.6.</li>
                <li>The Dynamic attach method is not available if you are profiling a remote application.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
