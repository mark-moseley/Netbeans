        <h2>Set Quick Filter Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You use the Set Quick Filter dialog box to specify classes or packages that you want to exclude or include when analyzing application performance.
        Unlike global filters or custom filter sets, a quick filter can be applied only to the current application.</p>
        
        <p>You can access this window by selecting Quick Filter from the filter drop-down list in the Select Profiling Task dialog box.</p> 
        <p>You can set the following properties in the dialog box:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Filter Type.</b> Select Exclusive or Inclusive to specify if the methods are excluded or included.
            If Exclude is selected, none of the listed methods are profiled. If Include is selected, only the listed methods
            are profiled.</li>
            <li><b>Filter Value.</b> This text area lists the classes and packages that you want to include or exclude.
            You can type the name in the text area in the following formats:<br>
<pre>java.*
javax.swing.
javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser</pre>
            <p>You can quickly add classes in your project to the Quick Filter by doing the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the Profile Only Project Classes Filter in the Select Profiling Task dialog box.</li>
                <li>Click Show Filter Value to open the Profile Only Project Classes dialog box.</li>
                <li>Click To Quickfilter.</li>
            </ol>
            When you click To Quickfilter, the Set Quick Filter dialog box opens and the project classes are listed 
            in the Filter Value text box. You can delete or add classes by typing in the text box.</li>
            
        </ul>
