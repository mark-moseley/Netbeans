        <h2>Analyze Memory: Basic Options</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When analyzing memory usage, you can configure basic and advanced options for the profiling session.
        The following basic options are available when analyzing the lifecycle of objects.
        If you are configuring a custom configuration, click Advanced Settings to specify <a href="csh_memory_options_adv.html">advanced options</a></p>
        <p>When analyzing memory usage, you specify one of the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Record object creation only<!-- (Object Allocation Profiling)-->.</b> 
            When selected, profiling the application gives you information about the number, type, and 
            location of objects that have been allocated. When this option is selected, 
            all classes currently loaded by the target JVM (and each new class as it is loaded) are instrumented 
            to produce information about object allocations.
            This profiling mode is a functional subset of recording both object creation and garbage collection and
            has a smaller performance and memory overhead.</li>
            <li><b>Record both object creation and garbage collection<!-- (Object Liveness Profiling)-->.</b> 
            When selected, profiling the application gives you information on object liveness
            such as about how many objects of each type are still alive, as well as data on live objects.
            This options incurs a greater profiling overhead than selecting object creation only.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally, you can set the following options:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Track every X allocations.</b> Sets the interval /proportion 
            for stack sampling, e.g., if set to 10, this means that 
            for each class only every 10<SUP>th</SUP> object allocation will be recorded 
            completely.<br>
            (This only applies to stack sampling 
            and tracking the object. The total number of 
            object allocations is recorded separately, and includes all allocations.)
            To record all information for each object, set this number to 1. However, doing this may substantially 
            affect the profiling overhead when profiling allocation-intensive applications. For 
            server-side applications under real-life workload conditions, setting this
            number to 20 or more should be sufficient to minimise the overhead, 
            and still obtain sufficient information for practical purposes.</li>
        
            <li><b>Record Stack Traces for Allocation.</b>
            When selected, the full call stack is recorded.
            Selecting this option enables you to view the reverse call tree for method calls when viewing a memory snapshot.</li>
            <li><b>Use defined Profiling Points.</b> When selected, any actions that are initiated by enabled profiling points 
            in the project are performed. Disabled profiling points are ignored. When deselected, all profiling points in the project
            are ignored.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Overhead bar graph provides you with a rough indication of the overhead that will
        be incurred when you profile the application with the current settings.</p>
