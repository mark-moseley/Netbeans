        <h2>Profiling a Remote Application</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p> 
                <p>You can profile an application that is running on a remote system by attaching the profiler to the application.
                To profile an application that is running on a remote system, the remote system needs to be configured to
                support remote profiling. </p>
                <p>You use the Attach Wizard to specify the attachment settings that are specific to your configuration.
                In the Attach Wizard you specify the type of application and the remote location.
                Based on the details that you provide, the Attach Wizard provides you with a set of instructions on how to 
                configure the remote system to support profiling.</p>
                 
                <p>After configuring the remote system according to the instructions, you can attach the profiler to the remote location.
                You only need to configure the attach mode once. The attachment settings are associated with that project. 
                You can go through the Attach Wizard at any time to change any of the attachment settings.</p> 
                
                <p><b>To profile a remote application:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose Profile &gt; Attach Profiler from the main menu.</li>
                <li>Select the Project from the dropdown list at the top of the Select Profiling Task dialog box, if available.</li>
                <li>In the bottom of the dialog box, click <b>define</b> to configure the attachment settings.</li>
                <li>Select the type of application.</li>
                <li>Select the server type, if necessary.</li>
                <li>Select the Remote attach mode and click Next.</li>
                <li>Complete the Attach wizard to specify the attachment settings according to the target application.</li>
                <li>Click Finish to exit the Attach wizard.</li>
                <li>Configure the target location and start the remote application according to the instructions provided in the Attach Wizard.
                <p>When you start the remote application, the application will wait until the IDE is attached before starting.</p></li>
                <li>Select a profiling task and any profiling options.</li>
                <li>Click Attach.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>When you click Attach, the IDE will attach to the remote JVM and the application will start.
        You can view profiling data like you would for a local application.</p>
            
            <p>After the IDE is attached to the remote application you can do the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detach from the remote application.
                <p>When you detach from the remote application, the remote application does not stop 
                but you stop receiving profiling data about the remote application.
            To attach to the remote application you need to use the startup options provided by the Attach wizard and 
            start the remote application again.</p></li>
                <li>Modify the profiling session.
                <p>You can modify the profiling session without detaching from the remote application.
            For example, you can change the profiling task to monitoring to reduce the profiling overhead, and then
        modify the task again later. This way you do not need to reattach and restart the remote application.</p></li>
            </ul>
            
            
 <!-- TODO need to describe what happens here       
 <p>When you click Run  </p>-->
<!--
                <li>In the Attach Wizard, select the type of application you want to profile.
                <p>If you select J2EE Web/App Server, you also need to specify the type of server.</p></li>
                <li>Select the Remote attach mode, an invocation type and click Next.</li>
                <li>Supply the Hostname and Host OS of the remote location.</li>            
            
            The Attach Wizard enables you to configure how Profiler is attached to an application.
    To attach Profiler to an application, you need to first specify the type of application details of the application.</p>	
        
        <p>The Attach Wizard is available when you choose 
		Profiler &gt; Attach Profiler from the main menu. 
		Before you open the wizard, ensure that your project is selected 
		in the combo box at the top of the Select Profiling Task window.</p>
		<p><b>To use the Attach Wizard:</b></p>
		<ol>
   			<li>Click Attach Wizard in the Select Profiling Task window.</li>
   			<li>Select the target type (and server type if the target is a J2EE Web/App Server) and click Next.</li>
 			<li>Select the application or server location, do the following and click Next.
				<ul>          
				<li>If the location is remote, supply the Hostname and Host OS.</li>
          			<li>If the location is local, select either Direct or Dynamic attachment. 
					(If you select Dynamic attachment, you need to specify the working directory and 
					how attachment is invoked in the next step.)</li>
				</ul>
        	</li>
			<li>Review the attach settings and do one of the following:
				<ul>          
					<li>Click Next if you want to specify the integration type, 
					the target JVM and view the integration steps. The integration 
					steps provide detailed information on how to integrate the 
					Profiler with the application. If this is the first time you have 
					attached profiler to the application, it is recommended that you 
					thoroughly review and understand the integration steps.</li>
    				<li>Click Finish and exit the wizard if you do not need to specify 
					or modify the integration type.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

<!--
<p>When attaching Profiler to an application, the application needs to be running
        on JDK 1.5.04 or on a customized JVM. The customized JVM 
		is available as a separate download from the Profiler website.</p>
        <p>The Profiler JVM is located in the directory 
        <tt>userdir</tt> &gt; <tt>module</tt> &gt; <tt>profiler-ea-vm</tt>.</p>
        <p>When you need to profile any code in the target application, you 
        invoke a command in Profiler that sends an OS signal to this JVM that  
        loads and activates the Profiler VM-side library.</p>
        <p><b>To start the application on the modified JVM:</b></p>
        <ol><li><b>Locate the customized Profiler JVM.</b> The Profiler JVM is 
            located in the directory:<br><tt>userdir</tt>&nbsp; 
            <img src="img/arrow.gif" width="5" height="11" alt="submenu">&nbsp; 
            <tt>module</tt>&nbsp;
            <img src="img/arrow.gif" width="5" height="11" alt="submenu">&nbsp; 
            <tt>profiler-ea-vm</tt>.<br>
            The directory path may look like this:<br>
            <tt>/home/johnsmith/.netbeans/3.6/modules/profiler-ea-vm</tt><br>
            (on UNIX&reg)<br>
            or<br>
            <tt>c:\Documents and Settings\JohnSmith\.netbeans\3.6\modules\profiler-ea-vm</tt><br>
            (on Windows).<br>
            (replace "<tt>johnsmith</tt>" with your login name in these examples)</li>
            <li><b>Launch the target application on the modified JVM.</b> Launch the 
            application as you usually do but specifying the path to the modified 
            JVM's executable on the command line, which may look something like this:<br>
            <tt>
            C:\j2sdk1.4.2_06\demo\jfc\SwingSet2&gt;D:\userdir\modules\profiler-ea-vm\jre\bin\java -jar SwingSet2.jar</tt></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The application is now running on the modified JVM. Profiler can now be attached
        to the running application. For more, see <a href="profile_running.html">Attaching Profiler to 
        a Running Application</a>.</p>
