        <h2>Edit Global Filters Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>When profiling an application, you use this dialog box to edit, delete or modify global filters that are used in filter sets.
        You use filter sets to limit the classes that are profiled when analyzing application performance.</p>
        
        <p>You can access this window by clicking Edit Global Filters in the Customize Filter Sets dialog box.</p> 

        <p>The dialog box lists the names and values of the defined global filters.
        You can manage the filters using the buttons to the right of the list of filters.</p> 
        <ul>
            <li><b>New.</b> Click New to create a new row in the list and type the new name and values directly in the fields in the list.</li>
            <li><b>Edit.</b> Select a filter from the list and click Edit to modify the filter. 
            Type directly in the field in the list to edit the name or value. 
            You can also edit a field by double-clicking in the field.</li>
            <li><b>Delete.</b> Select a filter from the list and click Delete to remove the filter from the list.</li>
            <li><b>Move Up</b> and <b>Move Down.</b> Select a filter from the list and use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the list order.
        The new order is also displayed in the Customize Filter Sets dialog box.</li>
        </ul>
       
        
        <p>Each global filter represents groups of patterns that are typically related to one application. 
        For example, <tt>org.netbeans</tt> is a pattern.
        A filter can contain more than one pattern. Patterns can be separated by a comma and/or space.</p>
        <p>Filters are applied in a "starts with" manner. 
        For example, if the filter contains <tt>org.netbeans</tt>, classes in the package <tt>org.netbeans.modules.classfile.Annotation</tt> would be matched by the filter.<p>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Using <tt>*</tt> in the pattern has no impact on filter behavior.</li>
        </ul>
