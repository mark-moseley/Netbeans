/**
* The message formatter, which uses map's keys in place of numbers.
* This class extends functionality of MessageFormat by allowing the user to
* specify strings in place of MessageFormatter's numbers. It then uses given
* map to translate keys to values. It also handles conditional expressions.
*
* You will usually use this formatter as follows:
* 	<code>JMapFormat.format("Hello {name}", map);</code>
*
* For conditional expression:
*       <code>JMapFormat.format("Hello {name,old_suffix,new_suffix,no_match}"); </code>
*  Last three parameters are optional. At first, name is translated. If it then has
*  suffix old_suffix it is replaced by te new_suffix else whole parrent is replaced by
*  no_match string.
*  
* Notes: if map does not contain value for key specified, it substitutes
* the value by <code>"null"</code> word to qualify that something goes wrong.
