/** <B>Java Module General API Test: SourceGenerator</B>
 * <BR><BR><I>What it tests:</I><BR>
 * This test is more complex and checks adding Elements (especially order of adding).
 * Test is focused on checking of correctness of generated code.
 * <BR><BR><I>How it works:</I><BR>
 * New class is created using DataObject.createFromTemplate().
 * Then all possible Elements are added.
 * These actions cause generating of .java code. This code is compared with supposed one.

 * Generated Java code.
 * <BR><BR><I>Possible reasons of failure:</I><BR>
 * <BR><BR><U>Elements are added into bad positions or even not at all</U><BR>
 * See .diff file to get which ones
 * <BR><BR><U>Bad indentation</U><BR>
 * This is probably not a bug of Java Module. (Editor Bug)
