    <title>New PHP Project without Previously Developed Sources: Configure</title>

    <h1>
       Creating a PHP Project without Previously Developed Sources
    </h1>
    <p>
       <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the Project Name text field, enter the name of the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Sources Folder field, specify the folder on your web server where you want to store
        your source files.<br>
         Because the wizard presupposes that you will store the source files on the local web
        server, the field by default specifies the following path: <tt>&lt;Document
        Root&gt;\&lt;New PHP Project&gt;</tt>. The document root is the folder where the local web
        server looks for files to open in the browser. The document root is specified in the web
        server configuration file.<br>
         The wizard detects the Apache installation type, either a component or within a package,
        and provides the path to the default location of the <tt>htdocs</tt> folder for the current
        installation type. Therefore, if you accepted the default settings during the installation
        of the Apache server or the AMP package, choose the path from the dropdown list.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the Default Encoding dropdown list, choose the default encoding for your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        To store the project internal files separately from the source files, select the Put
        NetBeans metadata into a separate directory checkbox. In the Metadata Folder text field,
        specify the folder where you want to create a subfolder for storing the internal files for
        your project. Use the Browse button if necessary.<br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Click Next. The <a href="new-project-run-configuration.html">Run Configuration</a> panel
        opens.
      </li>
