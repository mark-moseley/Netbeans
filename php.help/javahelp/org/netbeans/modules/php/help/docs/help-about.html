    <h2>
       About PHP Development in the NetBeans IDE
    </h2>
    <p>
       The NetBeans IDE for PHP provides tools for programming in the PHP language.
    </p>
    <p>
       The Project Creation wizard enables setting up new PHP projects and importing previously
      developed source files.
    </p>
    <p>
       The PHP editor provides the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Syntax highlighting
      </li>
      <li>
        Showing occurrences
      </li>
      <li>
        Code completion
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       You can also run and debug PHP applications in the IDE in three modes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Local web server
      </li>
      <li>
        Remote web server with FTP connection
      </li>
      <li>
        Script
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try: 
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer"> 
<param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/"> 
<param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u>"> 
<param name="textFontSize" value="medium"> 
<param name="textColor" value="blue"> 
</object> 
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.: 
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a> 
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
