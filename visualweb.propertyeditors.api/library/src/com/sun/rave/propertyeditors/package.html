        <p>A library of general purpose property editors.</p>
        <p>These editors are interfaces only, not instatiable classes
    that provide actual editor functionality. They are intended to be used
    only as arguments to 
    {@link java.beans.PropertyDescriptor#setPropertyEditorClass}. They are
    substituted by the IDE for implementations that provide the actual funtionality,
    using a service provider interface.</p>
