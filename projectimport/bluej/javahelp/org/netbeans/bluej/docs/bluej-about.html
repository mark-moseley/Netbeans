<h2>About Using NetBeans IDE BlueJ Edition</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Welcome to NetBeans IDE BlueJ Edition. If you have been using BlueJ 
to learn Java technology, NetBeans IDE BlueJ Edition is a logical next tool for 
learning Java programming and creating your first real world applications. </p>
<p>This BlueJ Edition of NetBeans IDE is a scaled down version of the NetBeans IDE that is 
customized for people who are used to using BlueJ. You can create new projects and files 
much as you would in BlueJ and then take advantage of NetBeans IDE coding productivity 
and project management features to extend the range of your applications.</p>
<p>NetBeans IDE provides a wealth of features that make it easier to code applications 
of all sizes. These features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/javahelp/editing/codecompletion/intro.html">Code completion</a>, 
    which helps you find and quickly fill in classes, methods, and fields. 
    The code completion window is paired 
    with a Javadoc box that displays documentation for the code elements that 
    you browse in the code completion box.</li>
    <li>Marking of syntax errors in the Source Editor <i>before</i> you compile.</li>
    <li>A variety of 
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/javahelp/editing/editor_navigation.html">navigation commands</a> that enable you to easily navigate between 
    code elements and files.</li>
    <li><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/javahelp/editing/macros/abbreviations.html">Code templates</a> that allow you to enter long code snippets with just a few 
    key strokes.</li>
    <!-- TODO fill in cool things -->
    <!-- TODO - hippie completion; bracket matching, hippie completion, ctrl-shift-f-->
</ul>
<p>The BlueJ Edition of NetBeans IDE is designed so that you can work in either 
of or a combination of the following two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep working with the BlueJ project structure but take advantage of the 
    NetBeans IDE coding productivity features.</li>
    <li>Convert to the NetBeans IDE project structure in order to create larger, 
    more scalable projects.</li>
</ul>
