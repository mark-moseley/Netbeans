<p>Welcome to NetBeans IDE BlueJ Edition. If you have been using BlueJ 
to learn Java technology, NetBeans IDE BlueJ Edition is a logical next tool for 
learning Java programming and creating your first real world applications. </p>
<p>This BlueJ Edition of NetBeans IDE is a scaled down version of the NetBeans IDE that is 
customized for people who are used to using BlueJ. You can create new projects and files 
much as you would in BlueJ and then take advantage of NetBeans IDE coding productivity 
and project management features to extend the range of your applications.</p>
<p>NetBeans IDE provides a wealth of features that make it easier to code applications 
of all sizes. These features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="nbdocs:/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/javahelp/editing/codecompletion/intro.html">Code completion</a>, 
    which helps you find and quickly fill in classes, methods, and fields.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<p>These help files are optimized for the NetBeans IDE standard distribution, 
not this special BlueJ Edition of NetBeans IDE.</p>
