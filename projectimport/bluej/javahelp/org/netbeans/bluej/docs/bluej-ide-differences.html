<h2>Differences in the BlueJ Edition of the IDE</h2>

<p>The BlueJ Edition of NetBeans IDE is a simplified version of the NetBeans IDE. 
Some of the help topics that you find in the IDE Basic, Java Project Basics, 
and Servers and Databases section might contain information that 
is not true for the BlueJ Edition.</p>
<p>The differences between the BlueJ Edition and standard distribution of NetBeans IDE 
can be grouped into the following four categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Different default settings</b>. Some IDE settings are different between the 
        two versions of the IDE. You can change the IDE's settings in the Options window  
        (Tools &gt; Options). The following are some of the differences in the BlueJ Edition:
        <ul>
            <li>The code completion box does not appear automatically when you are typing 
            in the Source Editor. However, you can open the code completion box by 
            pressing Ctrl-Space.</li>
            <li>Code templates are activated by pressing Shift-Space instead of by Space.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Different windows open by default</b>. Some windows that are 
    open by default in the standard distribution (such as the Files and Runtime 
    windows) are hidden by default 
    in the BlueJ Edition. You can use the Window menu to open any of these 
    windows.
    <li><b>Disabled Features</b>. 
    Many features available in the standard NetBeans IDE distribution are included 
    in the BlueJ Edition, but disabled by default. You can 
    enable and disable modules in the IDE's Module Manager (Tools &gt; Module Manager). 
    These features include the following:
    <ul>
        <li><b><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/editing/editing_hints.html">Java Editor Hints</a></b>. 
        Provides suggestions for fixing common coding 
        mistakes and then generates code to fix the problem.</li>
        <li><b><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/refactor/aboutRefactoring.html">Refactoring</a></b>. 
        A set of commands that allow you to change code 
        and automatically have those changes reflected throughout your project.</li>
        <li><b><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/editing/todo_window_csh.html">Task List</b>. 
        Scans your code for certain notes 
        (containing strings such as "TODO" or "FIXME") and displays those notes 
        in a list.</li>
        <li><b><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.javacvs/org/netbeans/modules/versioning/system/cvss/docs/cvsmodule/cvs-lite_about.html">CVS Support</b>. 
        Provides integration with the CVS version control 
        system in the IDE.</li>
        <li><b>Database tools</b>. Provide tools for working with databases, 
        such as the Database Explorer and an SQL Editor.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><b>Excluded Features</b>. The BlueJ Edition does not contain the standard distribution's
    support for creating web applications and enterprise applications. 
    If you want these features, you need to

        <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
        <param name="textColor" value="blue">
    </object>.
    <p>In addition, you can not install add-on packs (such as the NetBeans Mobility Pack and 
    the NetBeans Profiler) into the BlueJ Edition.</p></li>
