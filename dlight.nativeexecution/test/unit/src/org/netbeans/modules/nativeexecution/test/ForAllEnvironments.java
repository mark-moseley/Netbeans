/**
 * Annotate a test method with this annotation in the case you want it to be invoked
 * for each execution environment specified in .cndtestrc
 *
 * To put it more precise:  
 * 
 * In the case your method is annotated with this annotation,
 * NativeExecutionBaseTestSuite.addTest will create an instance of your class
 * for each such method and for each execution environment
 * (gotten from .cndtestrc/.testuserinfo). The constructor with (String, ExecutionEnvironment)
 * signature will be invoked in this case.
 *
 * (Note that such test method should be public, have void return type and no parameters)
 *
 * In the case test method it is not annotated, 
 * constructor with a single String parameter (test name) will be used,
 * only one instance of the class per test method will be created.
 *
 * All the above is true in the case you use NativeExecutionBaseTestSuite
 * and NativeExecutionBaseTestCase descendants for suite and tests.
 * Otherwise the annotation is just ignored.
