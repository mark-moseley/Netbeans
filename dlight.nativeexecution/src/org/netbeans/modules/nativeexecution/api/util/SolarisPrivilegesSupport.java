/**
 * Supporting class to provide functionality of requesting additional
 * process privileges (see privileges(5) to an execution session.
 * <br>
 * Execution session is either an ssh connection to a remote host or the
 * Runtime.getRuntime() for a localhost.
 * <br>
 * In case of localhost privileges will be granted to the current JVM process;
 * In case of remote - to the remote sshd process.
 * <br>
 * So, once execution session got needed privileges, any submitted task whithin
 * this session will inherit them.
 * <br>
 * To grant requested privileges a root password is needed. Password is prompted
 * but is never stored. So the password is asked for every new execution session.
