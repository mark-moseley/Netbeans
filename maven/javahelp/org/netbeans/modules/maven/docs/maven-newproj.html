        <h2>Creating a Maven Project</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
        <p>
        The New Project wizard enables you to create a new Maven project based on an archetype in your local or
        a remote repository.
        Archetypes provide the template that the IDE uses when creating a Maven project.</p>
        <p>If you have an existing Maven 2 project that contains <tt>pom.xml</tt> you do not need to use the New Project wizard.
        You can open the project by choosing Open Project (Shift-Ctrl-O) from the main menu.</p>

        <p><strong>To create a new Maven project</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project from the main menu to open the New Project wizard.</li>
            <li>Choose the Maven category and then choose a Maven project template. Click Next.
            <p>If you choose the Maven Project template you will need to choose an archetype.
            The wizard displays the available archetypes contained in your local or registered remote repository.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>Specify the project name, location and project details. Click Finish.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When you click Finish, the IDE creates the Maven project and displays the node for the project
        in the Projects window.
        After you create the project, you can configure the properties for the project by right-clicking the project
        node in the Projects window and choosing Properties.</p>
