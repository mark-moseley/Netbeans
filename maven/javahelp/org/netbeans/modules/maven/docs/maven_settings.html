<h2>Configuring Maven Settings</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>You can configure Maven settings at the IDE level and at the project level.
At the IDE level you can configure Maven installation and repostiory details.
At the project level you can configure Maven profiles for each project and
bind IDE actions to Maven goals for each project.</p>

<p>You configure Maven settings that effect the
behavior of Maven in the IDE in the Options window.
In the Options window you can specify your local Maven installation,
the location of the local Maven repository and settings for updating the repository.</p>

<p><strong>To configure Maven settings for the IDE:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the main window, choose Tools &gt; Options. </li>
  <li>Click the Miscellaneous category and then click the Maven tab.</li>
  <li>Modify the properties as desired. </li>
</ol>

<p>By using the project's Properties window you can configure Maven settings for an individual project.
You can create named configurations and then bind Maven goals to IDE actions and assign the
binding to a configuration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window and choose Properties. </li>
  <li>Cick the category in the left pane and modify the properties in the right pane. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Using Project Configurations</h3>
<p>The Configurations category enables you to enable and disable the configurations option for your project
and create new named configurations.
If you enable the option you can create named configurations that can be selected when binding
an IDE action to a Maven goal in the Actions category of the Properties window.
<!--A configuration enables you to customize how your project is loaded and executed-->.</p>
<p>You can switch to a configuration by right-clicking the project node in the Projects window and
choosing Set Configuration.
If your project is set as the main project in the IDE you can also
switch configurations using the drop-down list in the toolbar.</p>

<p>Using a profile enables you to do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Load the project in the IDE with a customized set of dependencies or submodules.</li>
    <li>Every action triggered with the configuration will have it's profile(s) also activated for building,
    running or debugging the application.
    Thus you can have alternate setup for various plugins and easily switch between them.</li>
    <li>Once configurations are enabled, other panels in the Project properties dialog
    (currently Actions panel for all project packagings and the Run panel for "jar" packaging)
    add a combobox with existing configurations and let you customize the IDE actions on a
    per configuration basis.
    For example each configuration can run the project with different main class setup.
    Or with different parameters passed into the main class. </li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO Confirm this -->

<!--
Hint: In case you have configurations disabled but still want to have the project loaded with specific profile(s) on,
please refer to the project's popup menu and find the "Profiles" sub menu.
There you can select profiles you want to have activated when the project loads.
Please not that when you enable configurations, the Profiles action disappears
and you are expected to use Configurations to get the same result.
-->

<h3>Binding Maven Goals to IDE Actions</h3>

<p>You can use the Actions category to customize IDE actions by binding the action to a default Maven goal.
The right panel lists all available default project actions that can be mapped.
When selecting one from the list the textfields in the bottom allow to change the values.
</p>
You can customize 3 basic properties

    * What goals get executed
    * What profiles get activated
    * What properties get set on the command line. These generally customize behavior of the executed goal.

If you have modified the default value in any way, the action in the list will be shown in bold
letters to show that you have a project specific mapping for the action.


Apart from the default action mappings, you can define custom executions for the project by clicking
on the Add Custom... button.
Such custom items appear in the project's popup menu under "Custom...".
Additionally you can define such execution definition for the whole IDE installation on
Tools/Options dialog.
Go to Miscellaneous/Maven panel there and setup the global execution definitions there.
