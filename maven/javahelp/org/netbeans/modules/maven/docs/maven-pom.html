        <h2>Working with the Maven POM</h2>
        <p>The basic unit of work in Maven is the Project Object Model (POM) that is contained in <tt>pom.xml</tt>.
        <tt>pom.xml</tt> contains information about the project and configuration details 
        such as project dependencies and build profiles that Maven uses to execute goals and build the project.</p>
        <p>For more details about POM elements, see the following pages on the Maven site:</p>
