        <h2>Building a Maven Project</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
        <p>The Maven build lifecycle has defined phases with goals that are executed when building and distributing an artifact.
        When you execute a goal, the Maven will also execute all the preceding goals in the build lifecycle.
        You can invoke phase goals and plugin goals by mapping the goals to IDE actions, or you can 
        create custom goals and invoke the goals individually.</p>

        <p>
            
            If you build your project and one of the goals is to package the artifact, 
        the artifact is automatically added to your local repository.

        </p>

        <h3>Executing Maven Goals in the IDE</h3>
        <p>Maven phases and goals can be mapped to the IDE actions available in the popup menu when you right-click a Maven project.
        For example, by default the Build action in the IDE is mapped to the <tt>install</tt> phase in the Maven lifecycle.
        When you choose Build, the IDE executes the goals described in the <tt>install</tt> phase to
        package the project and executes all the goals in the preceding phases in the build lifecycle.

        The Maven output with the plugin and goal identifiers are displayed in the Output window.</p>

        <ul class="notes">
            <li>You can modify the mapped Maven goals that are invoked by IDE actions by configuring actions
            in the project's Properties window or in the Maven tab in the Options window.
            For more, see <a href="maven_settings.html">Configuring Maven settings</a>.</li>
        </ul>


You do not need to build the project or compile individual classes to run the project in the IDE.
By default, the IDE automatically compiles classes when you save them.
These incrementally compiled files are stored in a cache in your user directory and are copied to your project's build folder
when you run or debug your project.
This incremental compilation can save you a lot of time when you are editing and testing your project.
However, you need to build the project to generate distributable files for the project, such as JAR files.
By default, the Build Project command is not enabled since most of that command's functions are handled by the incremental compilation.
However, you can use the Clean and Build command to create a fresh build.
When you clean and build a project, all previous build outputs are deleted and new versions of the build outputs are created.

To build the main project and its required projects:
Choose Run > Clean and Build Main Project (F11).
The IDE displays the Ant output and any compilation errors in the Output window.
You can double-click any error to go to the location in the source code where the error occurred.
To build an individual project and its required projects:
Right-click the project's node in the Projects window and choose Clean and Build.










        <h3>Customizing the Build Process</h3>


        <p>To customize the build for a Maven project you modify the POM to add or reconfigure plugins and dependencies.
        You can use the code completion in the editor to help you when adding details to <tt>pom.xml</tt>.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open <tt>pom.xml</tt> in the XML editor.</li>
            <li>Choose Source &gt; Insert Code (Ctrl-I) from the main menu and select Plugin from the popup menu
            to open the Add New Plugin dialog box.</li>
            <li>Type a query term to search for the plugin.</li>
            <li>Select the plugin from the list of available plugins.</li>
            <li>Select the goals that you want to be executed. Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
<p>When you click OK, the IDE adds the plugin description to <tt>pom.xml</tt> and the goals to run as part of the build process.

</p>
        If you add a plugin that is not in the local repository, This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used - including a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the latest available).
