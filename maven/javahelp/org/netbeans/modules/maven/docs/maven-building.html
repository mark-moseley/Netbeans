        <p>What this means is that the process for building and distributing a particular artifact (project) is clearly defined.</p>

    <h3>Customizing the Build Process</h3>
        <p>To customize the build for a Maven project you modify the POM to add or reconfigure plugins.
        The code completion in the POM can help you locate and add the plugin details to <tt>pom.xml</tt>.

        <ol>
            <li>Open <tt>pom.xml</tt> in the XML editor.</li>
            <li>Choose Source &gt; Insert Code (Ctrl-I) from the main menu and select Plugin from the popup menu
            to open the Add New Plugin dialog box.</li>
            <li>Type a query term to search for the plugin.</li>
            <li>Select the plugin from the list of available plugins.</li>
            <li>Select the goals that you want to be executed. Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
<p>When you click OK, the IDE adds the plugin description to <tt>pom.xml</tt> and the goals to run as part of the build process.
</p>
        If you add a plugin that is not in the local repository, This plugin will be automatically downloaded and used - including a specific version if you request it (the default is to use the latest available).
