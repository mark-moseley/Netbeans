<h2>Monitoring Data Flow on the Web Server</h2>

The HTTP Monitor gathers data about HTTP requests that are processed by the servlet 
engine. For each HTTP request that is processed, the monitor records data about 
the incoming request, the data states maintained on the server, and the servlet 
environment. You can view data, store data for future sessions, and replay and 
edit previous requests. HTTP monitor data records are stored until you exit the 
IDE, unless you explicitly request otherwise. 
<h3>Displaying the HTTP Monitor</h3>
<p>You can view data about JSP and servlet file execution at any time. To start 
  the HTTP Monitor from the main menu bar, choose Debug <img src="../images/arrow.gif" 
width="6" height="13" alt="and choose"> HTTP Monitor or View <img src="../images/arrow.gif" 
width="6" height="13" alt="and choose"> HTTP Monitor.</p>
<p>The HTTP Monitor requires the internal web server to execute to receive data 
  from the execution web server. In other words, the HTTP Monitor does not record 
  data unless the IDE's internal HTTP service is running. If the internal HTTP 
  service is not running, you can view previously recorded data, but you cannot 
  replay data or view new data. </p>
