<h2>Viewing HTTP Monitor Data Records</h2>
<p><small>

</small></p> 

The HTTP Monitor consists of two panels. On the left, HTTP request records panel 
contains a tree view of HTTP monitor data records. On the right, the Record data 
display panel presents the data associated with the selected monitor records. 
<p>In the tree view, the All Records category contains two subcategories: Current 
  Records and Saved Records. Individual monitor data records reside in either 
  of these subcategories. Requests resulting in an internal dispatch cause nested 
  nodes on servers that support this functionality. The forwarded or included 
  requests are nested under the node corresponding to the main requests. </p>
<p>Entries in Current Records are available only during the current IDE session. 
  Current monitor data records persist across restarts of the server. They are 
  cleared whenever you exit the IDE, or when you explicitly delete them. Entries 
  in Saved Records persist until you delete them. Monitor data records in all 
  categories can be sorted according to various criteria using the buttons above 
  the tree view. </p>

    <td> If the HTTP Monitor does not show the data records for a running web 
      module, verify that the monitor is enabled for the server by right-clicking 
      on the server's node in the Runtime tab and choosing Properties from the 
      contextual menu. The Enable HTTP Monitor checkbox should be selected.</td>

<p>When you select a monitor data record in the HTTP request records panel, the 
  information corresponding to that monitor data record appears in the Record 
  data display panel. The data display panel consists of these tabs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Request.</b> Displays the request URI, method, query string, parameters 
    or posted data, protocol, client IP address, scheme, and the exit status of 
    the request. A list of request attributes before and after the request is 
    also provided. </li>
  <li><b>Cookies.</b> Displays a list of incoming and outgoing cookies, including 
    cookie name, cookie value, how long until the cookie expires, and whether 
    the cookie requires a secure protocol. </li>
  <li><b>Session.</b> Displays the status of the session before and after the 
    transaction and attributes of the session. It states whether the session was 
    created during the transaction. Session properties include session ID, creation 
    time, and time of last access. Access data after the transaction is also provided, 
    including session attributes and the maximum inactive interval. </li>
  <li><b>Context.</b> Displays the name and absolute path of the context of the 
    request, as well as context attributes and initialization parameters.</li>
  <li><b>Client and Server.</b> Lists the protocol, the client IP address, the 
    software used, the locales, and encoding, file formats, and character sets 
    accepted. Also includes the servlet engine properties such as the Java platform, 
    the Java version, the hostname of the servlet engine, and the port number 
    of the HTTP service. </li>
  <li><b>Headers.</b> Displays the HTTP headers that came in with the request. 
    The headers are constructed by the HTTP client, which is typically, a browser. 
    They contain information such as the nature of the client, including software 
    and operating system, language preferences, and the file formats that the 
    browser accepts.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
