SPI for providers of J2EE Web module oriented projects.

<p>This API will typically be used by modules that implement project types for
J2EE web module (various implementations of web module project, web module with
web services, portlets, etc.). It can be also used for implementation of web
module that is not based on Projects API.
</p>

<p>A module that implements this API needs to expose implementation of
{@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebModuleProvider} either in
project lookup (for implementations based on Projects API) or in global lookup.
The module will implement 
{@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebModuleImplementation}
and use {@link org.netbeans.modules.web.spi.webmodule.WebModuleFactory}
to create {@link org.netbeans.modules.web.api.webmodule.WebModule}.
