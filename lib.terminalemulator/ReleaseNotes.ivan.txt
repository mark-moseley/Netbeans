nobugid (bugs in line insertion/deletion w and w/o margins)
	Symptom:
		vi a file in a 24x80 terminal.
		^D
		line 23 isn't refreshed properly.
	Fix in Term.OpsImpl.op_al(), op_dl().

	Seems to have fixed another symptom where fast ^D'ing when
	running 'vim' resulted in the "middle" line having lots of []'s.

nobugid (towards distributing demo NBM)
	- Adjust Suite/build.xml to special-case the creation of
	  lib.terminalemulators nbm's because it can't be added to the suite.
	- Add extra.module.files to RichExecution's project.properties to
	  ensure that process_start* ends up in the NBM.
	- Enhance richexecution.PtyExecutor to "chmod u+x" process_start*
	  because when they are extracted from an NBM zip cannot maintain
	  their execution permission.
	- Module collateral information (Description home page etc.) filled in.

Started a debug/test infrastructure although it's not in the mainline
NB src code yet. The following were done to support it ...

nobugid (Suppport for raw pty's on linux)
	On Solaris one makes a pty raw by just not pushing the stream
	modules ptem ldterm and ttcompat.

	On linux pty's are be default non-raw. One can make them
	act like a raw terminal by using cfmakeraw(). It only 
	sets up a termios structure; one still needs to do a
	read/modify/write using tcgetattr() and tcsetattr().
	So added all of these to richexecution.PtyLibrary:
		class Termios		Linux only
		tcgetattr()
		tcsetattr()	plus relevant constants
		cfmakeraw()

	JNAPty.assigFd() and getFd() moved to new Util class.

	JNAPty now uses the above functions to do a read/modiy/write for
	raw pty's.

	richexecution.PtyLibrary.java
	richexecution.JNAPty.java
	richexecution.Util.java

nobugid (nbterm: couldn't find itself if executed through a soft link)
	Had to enhance the "find yourself" stuff at the beginning.

nobugid (nbterm: xterm-like -e and -geometry flags)
	The terminal debugging/testing infrastructure fires up nbterm
	and a reference existing implementation like xterm or konsole
	and broadcasts sequences to all for visual comparison.

	Needed to add -e and -geometry to nbterm for this to work.

	-e used to mean "try error detection mode". That is now
	renamed to -E.

nobugid (Term and ActiveTerm support for hyperlinks)
	Term will now recognize the sequence 
		<ESC>]10;<clientData>;<text><BEL>;
	as analogous to 
		<a href="clientData">text</a>
	and create hyperlinks.

	See http://wiki.netbeans.org/TerminalEmulatorHyperlinking for
	usage details.

	In addition to interpretation of the sequence in InterpDtTerm
	and it's implementation in Term.op_hyperlink ...

	This required a bit of support internally to help save and
	restore text attributes of regions enclosing hyperlinks:
		ActiveRegion.getParentAttrs()
		ActiveRegion.setParentAttrs()
		Term.attrSave()
		Term.attrRestore()

nobugid (de-publicize all ACT_ classes)
	All Interps use internal Actor classes using the naming convention
	ACT_. These classes were protected _and_ final and an eyesore
	in the javadoc.
	Made them package private.

124612 files lost when terminalemulator was moved to cnd
	The transfer of termulator from core to cnd was incomplete in two ways:

	1) Several files were dropped:
		   ReleaseNotes.ivan.txt 	(this file)
		   demosrc/buildtool/*
		   demosrc/telnet/*
		   test/unit/src/org/netbeans/lib/terminalemulator/TermTest.java
	   These files have been restored and brought up-to-date.

	2) Some changes were committed to CVS after the copy to cnd but
	   before the core copy was deleted so they got "lost".
	   These changes (tags ivan_24, ivan_23) have been reintroduced.

	Some more changes were never committed to CVS and missed both 
	the core-to-cnd copy as well as the CVS-to-Hg transition.
	These are documented below.

nobugid junit test failure on textWithin()
	In the process of reintroducing TermTest.java found that it fails.

nobugid Abstracting of Buffer and Line classes
	In order to be able to alter the implementation of Buffer, for
	instance to have it use java.nio.Buffer's like output2, have
	to make it be more abstract. To that end ...
	- Enhanced Buffer.printStats() to provide more detailed statistics.
	- Line.glyph_glyph -> Line.glyphId
	- Line.glyph_rendition -> Line.backgroundColor
	- new property glyphId
	- new property backgroundColor
	- - Line.charArray
	  + Line.accumulateInto
	- + Line.charAt(), charAtPut(), getChars()
	- Lot of code in Term.java used to pass a char buf[] around
	  which used to be a pointer directly into a Lines storage array
	  set in paint_line_new().
	  Now it uses Line.getChars() and a local xferBuf in myDrawChars().

nobugid Make Interp public
	On [fall 2007] Yarda, in order to satify some static code style checks,
	had, instead of making Term.setInterp(), getInterp() public, opted
	to make class Interp pkg private.

	Java apparently allows a sub-class of a package class to
	be passed to a parameter of the type of the package class.
	I.e. Interp is pkg private, MyInterp is public and extends
	Interp, ergo a public setInterp(Interp) is useful.

	Instead of quibbling, making Interp, setInterp() and getInterp()
	be public.

These changes were driven by trying to get Midnight Commander (mc) to work 
under term. mc, with it's heavy dependence on terminal graphics, seems
like a good litmus test.
With these fixes we're doing fine on output, except for "graphical character"
rendering. However, mc isn't very usable due to heavy dependence on function
key and mouse event processing which I leave for another day.

nobugid Handle "set text parameters" escape sequence ESC ] <p1> ; <p2> BEL
        Allows for various terminalemulator application text values like
        icon name, window title and current working directory to be set.
        We only handle these sequences so output from mc doesn't mess up
        the screen. While the sequences call new methods of class Ops,
	op_icon_name(), op_win_title() and op_cwd(), a terminalemulator
	_Application_ would still need some sort of listener mechanism
	to adequately handle these requests.

	Includes InterpDtTerm.ACT_DONE_COLLECT2.

nobugid Factoring of InterpDtTerm.ACT_DEC_PRIVATE
        Mainly as I was exploring sequences having to do with enabling of
        mouse reporting. See

nobugid Solitary attributed character in last column not rendered.
        scenario:
            Bring up 'vim', enter "aaa", enter ^V. A '^' will appear.
            In some environments the caret is blue and in such cases 
            the caret isn't rendered.
        cause:
            In Term.paint_line_new() in the case where we use runs we bail out
            too soon because of this test:
                if (rend+1 >= lastcol)
                    break;
        fix:
            Use > instead of >=.

nobugid TAB inserts spaces when it should only move the cursor.
        This became clear in a curses example submitted by a customer.
        Where curses uses TABs as a quick way to move around.
        Fixed in Term.OpsImpl.op_tab()

nobugid Handle ASCII SO and SI
        SO == ^N == Shift Out == LS1 == as    switch to VT100 graphical characters
        SI == ^O == Shift In  == LS0 == ae    switch to default rendition
        These were not handled and were just echoed, throwing off curses screens.
        Term.OpsImpl.op_as/ae() handle these.
        They are now absorbed but there is no real support for graphical
        characters yet.
        Unicode supposedly has 32 codes for them U+FDD0 thru U+FDEF but
        standard Java fonts render them as squares. And the mappings here:
            http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Unicode/Character_reference/F000-FFFF
        just show black squares.

	Added InterpANSI.Ascii, a convenience "enumeration" containing codes
	for common ascii characters.

nobugid remove deprecations
	- Switch to using setFocusTraversalKeys() as opposed to
	  the deracated isManagingFocus() (in Screen.java).
	- Use getScreen() as opposed to get getDisplay().

4921071 printing to the Process Output tab prevents using menus
	NetBeans has many request processors running at low P1 so
	a default priority (5?6?) for StreamTerm.OutputMonitor thread will
	swamp all the RPs if we have a firehose sub-process.
	Lowering the priority of StreamTerm.OutputMonitor to 1.

4898959 [Debugger Console]: copy/paste via mouse buttons don't work.
	With 1.4 we now can get a systemSelection in addition to
	systemClipboard so we can accurately implement X-windows-style
	selection semantics as follows:

	SunCopy		put Terms selection into systemClipboard (only if
			non-empty)
	SunPaste	stuff systemClipboard contents into Term buffer

	selection done	put Terms selection into systemSelection
	clear selection	put empty string into systemSelection
	middle click	stuff systemSelection contents into Term buffer

	The Term API has been extended with pasteFromClipboard() and
	pasteFromSelection(). The original paste() is now pasteFromClipboard()
	so NB OutputWindow works like before.

	Similarly we have copyToClipboard() and copyToSelection() and copy()
	is copyToClipboard() so NB OutputWindow works like before.

	Operations with the systemSelection only work if it is available
	on the host system (For example itis not available Windows).

	Mouse gestures to stuff the systemSelection _used_ to only work if the 
	autoInsert property is true. That was so that a casual text selection
	doesn't clobber the clipboard. Now that we have a distinction
	between the clipboard and selection this property is deprecated
	and it's setting will be ignored in favor of it always being
	true.

4898959 [Debugger Console]: copy/paste via mouse buttons don't work.
	Term used to ignore middle mouse clicks if any mousewheel support
	was available. Took that test out. See comments in mouseClicked().

36439 (output window gives ArrayIndexOutOfBounds for some characters)
	The wcwidth cache is allocated of size Character.MAX_VALUE
	and indexed by a 'char', so the only way it can get an AOB is
	Character.MAX_VALUE(\uffff) is passed to it. 
	Fixed by allocating one more cell.
	Can be easily verified by println'ing a \uffff but it's gotta go
	through internal execution.

17337 (CTRL-C to copy in Output Window causes it to scroll to bottom)
	'keystroke_set' is a collection of KeyStrokes in the form:
	       ks3 = getKeyStroke(VK_C, CTRL_MASK)
	we use Term.maybeConsume() in keyPressed and keyTyped events. During
	keyTyped the event->KS mapping gives us
	       ks2 = getKeyStroke((char) ('c'-64), CTRL_MASK)
	ks2 and ks3 while logically equivalent don't hash to the same so
	maybeConsume() says yes to ks2 and the Ctrl-C gets passed on.

	So to detect whether something in 'keystroke_set' needs to be dropped 
	we need to check at keyPress time but take action at keyTyped time.
	'passOn' helps us do that.

24824 (Focus problems with splitpane in OW)
4702175 (JScrollBar provide no focus feedback)
	Issue 24824 pertains mostly to the splitplane confusing things, but
	the scrollbars getting focus was muddying the waters.
	Workaround for 4702175 suggets to make the scrollbars not
	be focusable, so made the horizontal and vertical scrollbars non
	focusable. The effect of this is Ctrl-Tab will not shift
	focus to the scrollbars.

nobugid (Switched to timed repaint)
	Per Tims suggestion from issue 28297.
	I had noticed that pastes (now that I got them working) take an awful
	long time. A time delay of 20msec does wonders.
	This should pave the way for simplification of OuputTabTerm as I
	described in 28297.

36404 (Scrollbars should scroll faster)
	Until we agree on a common solution changed the rate from 50 to
	10 milli-seconds per frame.

nobugid (AOOB in Line.insertCharAt())
	With InterpANSI run Term under a real pty-based shell and
	run vi. Go into insert mode. Issue two ^t's and a {. Boom!
	Line.insertCharAt() could not handle insertions at columns past 
	thelength of the line. Fixed.

issue 24824 Focus problems with splitpane in OW
	Overrode setEnabled() for Term so it propagates

	It's a sensible thing to have in any case.
	
	However, I couldn't find the error and setEnabled() code in 
	OW that Ales was talking about. So passing the bug on

issue 30776 NPE when resizing output window
	Not enough info, so no action yet.

issue 31755 NullPointerException after resizing Output Window
	The basic problem was that Sel keeps the origin and extent of 
	the selection in unsorted order. Some methods, like paint() and
	getExtent, setExtent() compensate for this, but adjust()
	and intersects() didn't.

	Modified sel.adjust() to take a lastline argument as well.

	Moved sel.adjust into common area of Term.limit_lines().

nobugid Selection vanishes on resize
	This used to be done in Term.adjust_lines() to mimic DtTerm, where
	if you resize so that the current selection ends up going
	out the window the selection is cancelled.
	After fixing 31755 it seemed more practical to not nuke the
	selection (which is how xterm works).

issue 31951 Copy to clipboard removing empty lines in output window
	This was because Line.text would return a "" instead of a "\n"
	for "empty" lines. This was initially so so that selecting 
	the "empty lines" below the cursor would give "empty" selection
	strings. But we forego that in order to fix this bug.
	Turns out xterm also returns newlines for the "empty" lines
	below the cursor.
	Issue 21577 addresses the selectability of empty lines below the
	cursor, but that's orthogonal. Once we can't select these empty
	lines the fact that they return "" or "\n" per line becomes
	immaterial.

issue 27491 Output window Mouse Pointer
	Fixed part 2. Mouse pointer is now java.awt.Cursor.TEXT_CURSOR
	by default. This is consistent with xterm and DtTerm as well.
	This can always be overriden by using
		Term.getScreen().setCursor(...);

Text for bugs:

I"m marking this and other NPE related bugs as fixed with my commit
tagged ivan_17. For a thorough description read 
.../terminalemulator/ReleaseNotes.ivan.txt.
Since this is a rather radical change I'd rather see new bugs filed as
opposed to these being reopened.


nobugid slowdown due to accessibility
	When Assistive Technology latches on to a component various additional
	property changes get fired. These can be expensive so the usual
	trick is to only fire them if an AccessibleContext has been requested.

	However most apps (should) set the accessibleName() and that
	instantly creates on demand an AccessibleContext.

	For Term this means that every input character will fire 
	accessible property changes and we don't want thath. We only
	want to do this if some real AT is latched on to us.

	So, switched the test to test for an AccessibleText having
	been doled out.

issue 18575 DEFECT P3 PC Ivan@netbeans.org STAR ConcurrentModificationException
issue 20430 DEFECT P3 PC Ivan@netbeans.org NEW Deadlock during XTest

	All of these, I postulate, happen because Term has been used 
	incorrectly. Being that it is a JComponent it's state is only
	allowed to be modified from the AWT event dispatcher thread.

	The various NPE and similar problems that arose in the past
	were unfortunately treated by inserting 'synchronised' all over
	Term code (mainly because of my incorrect assumption that
	paints get called on a special repainter thread).  There's also
	one instance of using SwingUtilities.invokeLater() in scrollbar
	adjustment.

	With this commit I've reversed the situation.

	First, all uses of 'synchronized' in Term have been commented 
	out with the following pattern in the comment: "OLD NPE-x".
	This is to make sure that the _fix_ is fixing the problem and
	not the leftover synchronized's.
	In case of disaster the code can be reverted.

	Next, OutputTabTerm's invocations to Term were routed through 
	SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait() or invokeLater(). They're actually
	done through little utility functions called invokeNow and
	invokeLater which do the SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread() test.
	Every stack trace in the above issues has originated from
	OutputTabTerm so I'm reasonably confident that all the above
	issues will be addressed by this.

	invokeNow() is used for InputStream data. invokeLater() is used
	for actions which come over the dispatcher.

	Some minor discussion on nbdev raised the issue that invokeAndWait()
	might induce deadlock. I'd like to argue that this is fine as follows:

		First, using invokeAndWait() is the rightthing to do for
		the input. It provides a measure of flow control for the
		input source and doesn't swamp the AWT event queue.

		Second, if you use invokeLater(), because you're passing 
		character arrays, these arrays will have to be copied.
		There's no need for elaborate buffering and queueing 
		since each inner class Runnable which gets created gets
		it's own copy of the reference to the buffer, but the
		buffer does need to be copied.

		Third, as issue 20430 demonstrates, insertion of
		synchronised is no panacea. We do need queued serialization.

		Fourth, if we do get deadlocks because of invokeAndWait() we
		can revisit this question. Regardless, some form of
		SwingUtilities.invoke has to be used so this fix is
		in the right direction.

		Finally, I'm hard-pressed to see how a deadlock can occur.
		The character input to Term (see below for other "input")
		comes from an external process or an internal thread. For
		a deadlock to occur Term code has to vie for a resource that 
		the outputting task is holding. Term is extremely
		self-contained though. It does not call back into any
		NB code and therefore should not contend for any resources.
		(The only exception is the use of debugging println's in
		internal execution mode which usually cause an
		infinite recursion).

		P.S. I actually tried with invokeLater() for a speed
		comparison. To my surprise I discovered that the text gets
		all run in and stuff _as if_ ordering gets messed up or 
		the runnables get issued out of order. Instead of pursuing
		why I took this as further confirmation that invokeAndWait
		is the right decision. Come to think of it I just used
		invokeLater and didn't copy my buffers.

	Analysis of Term state modification

	In general Term state modifications come from these sources:
		putChar[s].
			This is the main source and it's the responsibility of
			the caller to call them on the right thread.

		Various property settings.
			Happen in constructors or as side-effects of user
			actions in the gui. So in general they should be safe.
			All other calls should be carefully scrutinized.

		Keyboard input
			Come in on the Event Dispatch thread and usually
			gets consumed or passed on to a listener.
			If LineDiscipline() is being used stuff gets echoed
			but we're still within the Event Dispatch thread.

		Srollbar notifications, mouse events ...
			All come in on the Event Dispatch thread.


	Various mutators in OutputTabTerm are ....

		Calls from OutputWriter methods of TermOutputWriter. These
		are the most important source and therefore use
		invokeAndWait().

		setPageMode()
		historySizeKeeper()
			Safe. Called from TermOutputWriter

		Calls from the constructors.
			Safe. No mutator is going to come in while
			in a constructor.

		toString()
			Unsafe.

		updatePasteAction <- updateCopyCutAction
		updateCopyCutAction < activated < TopComponent.componentActivate
			Safe.

		activateHyperlink
		gotoHyperlink
		invokeJumpListener
		etc.
		<- JumpActionPerformer[ActionPerformer].performAction
		CopyActionPerformer[ActionPerformer].performAction()
			Unsafe. Called from RequestProcessor.
			Handled with existing Mutex.EVENT.readAccess.

		Term.performAction() (only used for PopupAction)
			boils down to OutputTabTerm.performAction()
			Unsafe? ... F10 is broken.
			Already handled with existing Mutex.EVENT.readAccess.

		selectAll <- actionPerformed
		setHyperlinkNavigationEnabled <- doClear
		doClear <- actionPerformed
		doClear <- topComponentClosed
			Boils down to OutputTabTerm.actionPerformed()
			Safe. Called on dispatch thread

		checkFont <- setSettings
		setSettings <- propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent)
			Safe. Called on dispatch thread

	Escapes of Term
		OutputTabTerm provides a getTerm() method, allegedly for
		testing, but it still may be used so uses need to be
		scrutinized.

	Since I put a fair amount of work into being able to switch between
	grabbing Tab, Ctrl-Tab and all I"m commiting this code with all
	of that code still in AS WELL as Ctrl-T codes so it can be
	retrieved again and will shortly commit code that elides it.
	Here are the coupl a notes on that code.

		CtrlTab. I"m not happy with this decision, so currently
		you can do it both ways using the property grabFocusKeys()
		which is set to false by default. 

		The various issues and implementations are discussed in source
		comments in Term.java and Screen.java both beginning with 
			Dealing with focus traversal ...

	One of the problematic issues was that Ctrl-Tab (or Ctrl-T) would
	jump the screen and appear in the term (as boxes) if the OW
	is not ReadOnly. Solved this problem by introducing 
		setHyperlinkNavigationEnabled()
	which alters the keysets to consume or ignore Ctrl-T and
	Ctrl-Shift-T. This stuff kicks in as soon as some exceptions
	appear so normally these keys go through. Since the keyset
	is shared had to create two sets.

	There are still a fair number of overall accelerator issues 
	that still remain but I"ll close this bug and reopen a new one.

issue 18733 (Output Window & NotifyException not accessible)
	One previous "fix" to this which wasn't really was the setting
	of the name.
	- Modified Term's accessible context to pass on name setting
	  to the Screen which is the component relevant to accessibility.
	- USe tab.getName() instead of getName() in OutTermPane.<init>.
	  Otherwise only null names were being passed.

	The big chunk of work here is the adding of AccessibleText to 
	Screen and all the various support code that's needed for this.
	All the issues (and there are quite a few) are discussed in
	the Javadoc comment for Term.getAccessibleContext().

	I've unit-tested a fair amount of this functionality, but since
	I don't have access to actual assistive technology on my Sun 
	box I have no clue if any of this is adequate.

	I have not yet been able to determine if anything and what needs to
	be done with the following:

	- Implement AccessibleState. JTextComponent doesn't do anything
	  special with it, so Term doesn't need to either right?

	- Implement AccessibleComponent. This one is strange since I can't
	  find any Swing components that implement it!

	- Term does scrolling, so it would seem like some parts of it
	  need to implement accessible roles of VIEW and SCROLLPANE, but
	  it's not yet clear to me how Assistive Technology would be getting
	  information about this.

issue 24460 (Actions "Next/Previous Error" are still enabled after first ... )
	I had chopped up checkNextPrevActions() too much.
	Redid it and it's much simpler now as well.

	Renamed checkNextPrevActions() to updateNextPrevActions() to bering it
	in line with other similar functions.

issue 19156 (Not able to navigate to left/right in output window)
	Not just that but there is precious little keyboard navigation in
	Term. So this fix attempts to address as much as possible in
	the whole area of keyboard navigation. There are three rough areas:
	- Generic keyboard navigation
	- Error navigation
	- Selection via the keyboard.

	All new sequences are documented at the end of this section.

	OutputTabTerm has a private helper function oldBindings() which
	checks whether "-Doutput.oldbindings" was set and reverts to
	older behaviour.

	Generic keyboard navigation
	---------------------------
	Switched to a set of keyboard bindings that matches the JLF
	more closely. Moved the few that were implemented in
	OutputTabTerm to Term itself.

	Added Term.pageLeft(int n) and Term.pageRight(int n)

	While testing, ran into and fixed bugs in the horizontal
	scrolling mechanism whereas the cursor at the end of the line was
	not scrollable to ...
	- Term.possiblyHScroll() not uses the cursor position to extend
	  total buffer column size.
	- ColumnRight()'s limit check was incorrect causing bizarre
	  scrolling behaviour.

	Implemented the various bindings documented below.


	Error navigation
	----------------
	This area itself falls into several sub-parts ...
		- Treating errors as hyperlinks
		- "Whole" error hiliting
		- Hyperlink wrapping
		- Detecting of errors and utilisation of Term regions
		- Implementation issues and bwd compatibility.

    	NOTE: A lot of this work really should be done in ActiveTerm
	but I had to sort of exactly how OW does things before I could
	attempt to move the functionality down.

	Treating errors as hyperlinks
	.............................
	OW already tried to treat errors as hyperlinks so all I've done here
	is (almost) apply JLF rules of hyperlink navigation which are:

		- Links are traversed using Tab/Shift-Tab.
		- Links are activated using Space or Enter.
		- Traversed-to links are denoted using standard swing
		  selection feedback.

	There are a variety of inherent problems with these as well problems
	arising in the context of errors.

		- When showing and navigating java exception dump frames
		  the terminal is not in readonly mode so plain Tab, Enter
		  and Space are out of the question. Ctrl- versions are
		  used instead.

		- Tab and friends are also focus mgmt keys and it would all
		  work really well if we had not only focus next and prev 
		  idioms but also focus up and down idioms. Swing 1.4 is
		  anticipating this but the JLF spec seems to be lagging.
		  (See Component.setFocusTraversalKeys).
		  As it is Ctrl-Tab and Shift-Tab conflict with TabbedPane
		  and OW usurps them by hook and crook.

		- I don't like selection feedback to mark "current"
		  hyperlinks. If one selects elsewhere the location of the
		  current link gets lost.

		- There's no specification for denoting the currently
		  activated link.

	The whole things is also awkward for navigating compiler errors
	the way we're used to, so F12 and Shift-F12 still work like before.
	They just imply a next(prev) link combined with activation.

	"Whole" error hiliting
	......................
	Previously when navigating from one error you would get:
	a) A blue/underlined hyperlink like thing on one line.
	b) A grey character background for the whole error.

	Since we now use selection hilite to provide navgiation
	feedback, and since there's no accepted convention for denoting
	activated links, the grey background is used for denoting the
	currently activated hyperlink. NOTE: this is a short-term solution.

	(b) used to be ugly ... it used one per-character backgrounds
	and as a result had a staircasey look. Changed to full-line
	background colors. This neccessiated the addition of 
		Term.setRowGlyph()

	Hyperlink wrapping
	..................
	At the last (first) error a next (prev) action will have no effect
	but putting a message into the status bar, but one more action will
	cause the navigation wrap around to the first (last) error.
	This neccessiated the addition of 
		ActiveRegion.lastChild()
	to complement ActiveRegion.firstChild()


	Detecting of errors and utilisation of Term regions
	...................................................
	It also turned out that the way regions were created for compiler
	errors was very different from java exceptions. In the compilers
	case the boundries are know ahead of time and regions can be created.
	In the case of stack errors no regions are really created, the
	line is pattern-matched _after_ it's been sent to Term and an
	independent hit targeting scheme, based on the variable 'links', is
	used. So I switched this to on-the-fly pattern recognition with a
	small state machine. This way java exception hyperlinks are now
	treated more like regular errors and the whole 'links' mechanism
	can be eliminated in the future.

	As a result exception error navigation is a bit more predictable.

	This whole area is still waay too ad-hoc and brittle.


	Implementation issues and bwd compatibility
	...........................................
	Created a parallel set of variables and routines in OutputTabTerm
	to satisfy the new key bindings and semantics.

	old			new
	.....................................................
	nextPrevJump()		nextHyperlink | prevHyperlink
	changeCurrentregion()	gotoHyperlink()
				activateHyperlink()
	currentRegion		currentHyperlink

	oldBIndings() (mentioned above) plays it's biggest role here.

	The hardest part here was battling the focus manager for control
	over Tab, Ctrl-Tab, Shift-Tab. See the comments with the 
	heading "Dealing with focus traversal".



	Selection via the keyboard
	--------------------------
	This will be done later.



	Action			New binding		Old Binding	Where 
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	Scroll line up		Ctrl-UpArrow (1)	UpArrow		Term
	Scroll line down	Ctrl-DownArrow (1)	DownArrow	Term

	Scroll page up		PageUp					Term
	Scroll page down	PageDown				Term

	Scroll view left	Ctrl-PageUp (1)				Term
	Scroll view right	Ctrl-PageDown (1)			Term

	Scroll column		# No good binding available

	Next hyperlink		Ctrl-Tab (2) (3) (5)	DownArrow	OW
	Prev hyperlink		Shift-Tab (4) (5)	UpArrow		OW
	Activate hyperlink	Ctrl-Enter|Ctrl-Space (3)
							Enter|Space	OW
	Activate hyperlink	Single-click (6)	Single|Double-Click
									OW+Term

	Next Error & Activate	F12 (5)			F12		OW
	Prev Error & Activate	Shift-F12 (5)		Shift-F12	OW

	(1) Conflicts with JLF TabbedPane accelerators.
	(2) The highlighted errors are best described as hyperlinks hence
	    the generic treatment.
	(3) The general rule is that if there's no textual input that 
	    Tab should be used, a Ctrl-Tab is for cases where we have 
	    textual input because there Tab is meaningful. However 
	    it's very hard for users of Netbeans to know when an output
	    window pane is in "readonly" mode, so we basically say
	    always use Ctrl-ed variations so you don't have to think about
	    it.
	(4) Technically Shift- is a direction reverser, so if the forward
	    direction is Ctrl-Tab then the bwd direction should be 
	    Ctrl-Shift-Tab ... except that youhave to have fingers of a
	    Martian to be able to do that, so I've stuck to Shift-Tab.
	(5) If you reach the last (first) link/error next (prev) will
	    not work on the first try and will put out a message in the 
	    status bar. One more will cause a wrap then.
	(6) The original implementation was very confused about single vs
	    double click. So much so that I couldn't characterise it.
	    for example buld errors were navigable with a single click,
	    while exception errors had to be double-clicked.

issue 18733 (Output Window & NotifyException not accessible)
	Phase-I:

	Term is accessible with role PANEL. It's just a generic container.

	ScrollWrapper is accessible with role PANEL. It is just a wrapper
	around the horizontal scrollbar to help in it's placement.

	Screen is accessible with role SWING_COMPONENT.
	It should by rights be TEXT but it's very tricky to implement 
	one dimensional caret coordinates in a 2D text widget. So, that's
	for later.

	These "fixes" deal with the accessibility issue only very
	superficially. That is, all JComponents that go into Term implement
	Accessible and return a description and a reasonable, but
	not neccessarily useful, role.

	More needs to be done if these components are to be actually usable.
	- Screen needs to implement AccessibleText. 
	- Term combines a scrollview and a view into one widget while Swing
	  accessibility expects these to be independent. I"m not sure how to
	  address this. One way would be to create dummy widgets that declare
	  the roles SCROLL_PANE and VIEW just so they can work
	  with accessibility.

nobugid (OutputTabTerm timer was never really effective)
	While working on error/hyperlink navigation I noticed that 
	Term's refreshEnabled property was always on. This in effect makes
	the whole timer approach introduced by rmatous not work.
	
	The way that was supposed to work is:
		1) issue Term.setRefreshEnabled(false)
		2) process and send chars to term and trigger timer
		3) when timer fires cause a repaint.
	It looks like though that step (1) was never done.
	
	This is extremely puzzling since at the time (cvs log)
		rmatous turned on timer on 2001/09/03
	there was ample proof that the timer helped. My suspicion is that
	at around the same time, this happenned:
		rmatous fixed CopyMaker on 2001/08/28 13:09:12
	so Term gets buffered input and the improvement was attributed
	to the wrong fix.

	In any case I've introduced step (1) and measured an increase in
	speed.

	Also, the code in repaintTimer() where the refreshEnabled property
	gets saved, set and restored is all redundant, since the earlier
	call to flush() does all this anyway.

- performance - reduce Interp footprint
	This was based on an observation made by Tor that each Interp
	ends up creating redundant copies of it's tste tables.

	All Interps now have a static inner class InterpType which
	owns the state transition tables and defines the actions..
	Multiple instances of Interps of the same type share InterpTypes.

	Since the state transition actions are now implemented in the
	InterpType, they need to receive an instance of an Interp whose state
	they will be modifying. This is passed as an AbstractInterp.
	Occasionally the passed-in interp has to be cast to the appropriate 
	subclass of AbstractInterp.

	In order to reduce the number of these casts moved number parsing mgmt
	from InterpANSI to AbstractInterp.

	Some Interp subclasses achieved their means by modifying their
	state vectors! Since the vectors are now shared that won't do, so a
	more appropriate state stack was introduced into InterpDumb.
	The stack is cleared in reset().

	Files:
	AbstractInterp.java
	InterpANSI.java
	InterpDtTerm.java
	InterpDumb.java


- performance - user cheaper Interps by default.
	Jesse (I think) pointed out that NB in general has no use for 
	ANSI emulation, and that Term should by default use a "dumb" terminal.
	This should reduce the # of classes that get loaded in.
	This happens in the initialization of 'private Term.interp'.

- I18N
	This addresses the following issues:

	15333 Cursor isn't on end of text after using CTRL+C [V, ...]
	19570 I18N - The characters of the error message are overlaped.

	Basically Term can now properly handle non-latin characters, like
	Japanese. These issues were realy only the tip of the iceberg. Term
	did not really work with japanese until now.
	The following work:
		- Proper cursor position.
		- Proper handling of line wrapping and backspacing over it
		  (for when horizontallyScrollable is false). This is important
		  for the proper working of Solaris 'vi' in the ja locale.
		- Sane reaction to ANSI terminal control escapes.
		- Selection works.
		- Active regions work.
		- Backspace, TAB etc. work.

	There are two big parts to this

	- Rendering characters in grid/cellular fashion.

	  The book 
		Creating Worldwide software (second edition) (Prentice Hall)
		Tuthill & Smallberg
	  discusses (on p98) how some characters might be double width and
	  presents 'wcswidth(3)' and 'wcwidth(3)' to return the _display_
	  width of a given character. The underlying assumption here is that 
	  fixed width fonts are actually quantized width fonts.

	  This doesn't seem to be the case for Java fonts. For example the
	  default ja font I get has 7pixel wide latin characters and 
	  12 pixel wide japanese characters. What to do?

	  Write our own 'wcwidth' that uses Font.charWidth() and rounds it up
	  to a multiple of the width of the latin char sub-set.

	  But that's not enough. Graphics.drawString() will still advance
	  each glyph by the original width of the font, not our rounded-up
	  value. One solution is then to use a drawString() per character.
	  The adopted solution is instead to use GlyphVector's and
	  Graphics2d.drawGlyphVector() as used in Term.myDrawChars() and
	  Term.massage_glyphs(). Despite the hairiness of the code there
	  it turns out to be faster than a drawString() per char by
	  a good margin.

	- Accounting for the difference in Buffer vs Screen coordinates.
	  (A reading of the main javadoc comment for class Term would
	  help understand the rest of this).

	  So now we have a situation where a Line holds characters whose
	  positions are not neccessarily in a 1-1 correspondence with their
	  cell positions. Mappings are provided in both directions via 
	  Line.bufToCell() and Line.cellToBuf(). They are used in the existing
	  buffer to view coordinate xform functions (which for example map
	  a screen position to a character for the purpose of selection).
	  A variety of other locations had to be adjusted to use these for
	  proper operation. The driving algorithm for choosing what needs
	  attention was occurances of st.cursor.col since the cursor 
	  is in cell coordinates.

	  These function aren't "cheap" because they count from the beginning
	  of the line. Cacheing the values is impractical for the following
	  reasons:
		- You need to cache each mapping since they are used with equal
		  frequency.
		- Because Term allows horizontal scrolling a line can 
		  potentially be very long. The index into a line therefore 
		  will range from 0 to Integer.MAX_VALUE. This means
		  a cache of short's won't do.
		- So now we're talking a fair amount of memory that is 
		  probably not justifiable unless we come up with a way to
		  quickly dispose of the caches. Cache invalidation is
		  always a tricky problem, but I found out something else.
		  For a while I installed a wcwidth() cache per line (In
		  retrospect having wcwidth() manage the cache of course
		  made a lot more sense) but along the way I discovered
		  that the per-line cache gets invalidated quite often.
		  In effect the cache wouldn't have been helpful.
	  There are some pattern that could use improvement, a bufToCell
	  immediately followed by a cellToBuf, or a bufToCell(x) followed
	  by bufToCell(x+n). These could be collapsed into specialized
	  functions.

	Some neccesssary fallout from all of this ...

	- MyFontMetrics.wcwidth() is expensive given the number of times it
	  gets called so the resultant width is cached. The cache is indexed
	  by the char so is naturally Character.MAX_VALUE big. Not a big
	  chunk of memory in the big scheme of things but it can add up if you
	  have many Term instances. So there's a pool of them indexed by 
	  FontMetrics. It's unfortunately trickier than you'd think. 
	  See the opening comment in class MyFontMetrics for more info.

	- LineDiscipline had to be adjusted to do something reasonable
	  with backspaces in line buffered mode. There's a big comment in
	  LineDiscipline.sendChar(). 
	  To do this it reuires to have a back-pointer to the Term so
	  we now have StreamTerm.setTerm() which is used in 
	  Term.pushStream().

	- Dealing with double-width is expensive so we don't want to
	  compromise speed in 8-bit locales.

	  One way to deal with this is to query the "file.encoding"
	  property but I found that it's value is very variable from
	  Java release to Java release and probably from platform to
	  platform. In 1.4 class Charset is supposed to deal with this
	  but we're not ready for that switch yet.

	  What I opted for is having MyFontMetrics.wcwidth check for
	  variation from an initial width and set a flag (multiCell) 
	  on the first deviation. Various parts of the code then check
	  MyFontMetrics.isMultiCell(). So, for example, the painting code
	  now instead of calling Graphics.drawChars() will call 
	  Term.myDrawChars() which will based on this flag do the expensive
	  or the cheap thing.

	A note on ANSI emulation vs double-width characters.
	The ANSI standard doesn't talk abut double-width characters! So
	dealing with them is AFAIK up to individual vendors. I've
	followed Solaris'es DtTerm behaviour and spent a fair amount of
	time making sure that Solaris vi (which can excellently edit
	wide-char files under DtTerm) works under Term.

- bug: <noid> Junk characters inserted on character insert.
	Occasionally when charactes are shuffled in the Buffer, usually
	under vi, junk (usually 0) characters gets inserted into the
	Buffer instead of ' ' (ASCII SP)'s. These show up as "squares".
	Fixed in Line.insertCharAt(), Line.setCharAt() and
	Line.clearToEndFrom()

	Prior to JDK 1.4 ascii 0 was rendered by Swing as a blank.
	But under 1.4 this problem is a whole lot more visible.

- bug: <noid> Pathologically slow horizontal scrolling on long lines
	Was attempting to render all characters even those that are
	not in view. Fixed in Term.paint_line_new().

- bug: <noid> Cursor gets drawn on the glyph gutter on horizontal scroll.
	Fixed by adding an additional check in paint_cursor();

- deprecated: Term.goTo(Coord)
	Use Term.setCursorCoord(Coord) which matches getCursorCoord().

- Misc:
	public->private
		Buffer.visible_cols
	+	Buffer.visibleCols()
	+	StreamTerm.BUFSZ	(instead of hard-coded 1024)
	+ 	collection of statistics on linefeeds

	+	Term.charWidth(char)	// See section above on I18N.

- accessibility
	Term now implements Accessible and returns an accessible context.
	The "accessible description" is set.
	The "accessible name" is set from OW to be the same as the tab name.

- performance
	- Added Term.setKeyStrokeSet() in order to allow sharing of,
	  sometimes large, sets.
	  Added code to OW to take advantage of this.
	  See 'updateKeyStrokeSet()' and 'getCommonKeyStrokeSet()'.
	  This code also tracks changes to the global keymap so that Term will
	  now pass through newly added keyboard accelerators.

================================================================================
back to main 3.3. trunk

- bug: <noid> Missing ANSI escape sequence handling:
	- ESC [ 4 h     set insert/overstrike mode
	- ESC [ 4 l	reset insert/overstrike mode
	- ESC [ 4; 17 r	margin control (used by vim for sub-windows)
	- ESC c		full reset
	- ESC [ ! p	soft reset
	- ESC [ <n> n	status report. (used by unix command 'resize')
			This also required cursor positioning ('H') to clip
			as opposed to ignore out of bounds row and
			column settings.

- bug: <noid> Exception when running "xemacs -nw" under pty-based Term
	xemacs has a propensity to send cursor motion directives with
	rows that exceed the boundaries and the checks in Ops.op_cm()
	were inadequate.

- issue 16010 (Autoscrolling behavior of terminal not ideal)
	Added a new properties
		boolean scrollOnOutput
		boolean trackCursor
	to complement the existing scrollOnInput.
	When 'scrollOnOutput' is set to 'false', you can use the
	scrollbar to look at some text higher up w/o it moving from
	underneath you as more output is produced.

	This feasture is "smart" in the sense that if the cursor is visible
	(i.e. the user hasn't scrolled away from the cursor) Term will
	scroll to track the cursor even if scrollOnOutput is set to false.

	However the smarts only kick in if 'trackCursor' is set to true.

	Adjsuted in netbeans/core/output/OutputTabTerm.java as well by adding
	term.setScrollOnOutput( false ) etc.

- optimization
  Text with attributes (fg color, bg color, underline, active, etc) used
  to be rendered one character at a time and rather slowly.
  Switched to run-length based rendering where runs of characters
  with identical attributes are rendered together.
  Depending on the density of attributed text this has produced a *2 to
  *10 speedup in view painting.

  The function implementing this is Term.paint_line_new(). paint_line_old()
  has been kept around just in case.

- bug http://openide.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=16027:
  Missing/awkward selection access functionality
    + public void paste()
    + public void copy()
    + property selectionExtent is now bound and fireProprtyChanged() is issued
      when selection changes.

- bug http://openide.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=15953
  Exceptions when resized on selection.
  Fixed by adjusting selection in Term.adjust_lines.
  This is a stop-gap fix. All the selection adjustment code that uses
  Sel.intersection should be moved into Buffer methods.

- BG line stripe support (Term.setGlyph())
	- Eliminated interference between BG line strips and selection.
	  Did this by drawing the BG stripes before the selection in
	  Term.do_paint().
	- The stripes were being drawn in the gutters which made it look
	  funny. Now they're being draw only in the text area.

- bug <noid>
  BG color of characters would override Swing style selection.
  Fixed by having paint_line() not bother with BG rectangles if 
  the character falls into a selection and always set the character FG 
  color to the default fg.
  Added Extent.intersects(int, int) to help with this.

- bug <noid>
  From Ales and NB testers:
	> 1. When you run following simple program:
	>   public class Out {
	>       public static void main (String args[]) {        
	>           System.out.println("123");        
	>       }
	>   }
	> 
	>   and then you try to select more lines in OW, it looks strange. 
	>   - selection area ended somewhere in the middle of OW width
	>   - when you go (by selecting) behind OW right bound, squares will
	>     displayed in start of line (see squares.gif)
	>   - when you run this program second time, everything looks fine
	> 

	Reproduced and fixed.
	There are two parts to the problem:
	1) The selection is halfway through. 
	2) When you select and drag _out_ of the window you get the funny view.
	In both cases it had to do with (different) variables going below 0.
	Now, after a resize, line selection should extend all the way 
	and the drag right should work right.

- bug <noid>
  From Ales and NB testers:
	> 2. Sometimes (when playing with selection) we got NPE in 
	>   Term$Scroller.extend method, on 1125 line
	>   I found out, that sel.sel_extent is null from some reason
	> 

	This will happen if the selection "vanishes" while auto-scrolling
	is on. The way I reproduced it was by having a program trickle
	out a line of junk , once per second, then while it's running
	and scrolling select some test and drag up and out of the OW
	thereby starting the auto-scroller thread. Eventually the selection
	will go out of buffer history (If you have a short history or no
	anchors) and I got the same exception.

	I fixed it in Term.Scroller.extend() by checking for a null selection
	extent. That whole block of code is synchronized with Term.this
	which is the main lock for everything.

- Eliminated lots of OLD code.

+ Term.columnLeft(int n)
+ Term.columnRight(int n)
  These are analogs of lineUp/lineDown() for horizontal scrolling.

- auto-scrolling of dragged selections now works for both directions.
- auto-horizontal-scrolling to keep cursor in view. Only on input.
  This is tricky since because of non-local echoing the cursor position
  is not known on a keystroke. See comment above hscrollReset() for a
  detailed explanation of the design.

- bug <noid>
  Attributed text would not get rendered correctly on horizontal scroll.
  Fixed.

+ Horizontal scrollbars. Use
  	Term.setHorizontallyScrollable(boolean)
  to enable/disable it.
  Still needs auto scrolling and probably some other smarts.

- bug 15365 (View does't folow cursor - when writing)
  Fixed by adding a boolean property scrollOnInput() which by default is set
  to true.

- Added boolean property readOnly. When true, keystroke events and paste's
  are ignored.

+ Term.pageUp(int n)
+ Term.pageDown(int n)
+ Term.lineUp(int n)
+ Term.lineDown(int n)
	Scroll the view 'n' pages/lines up/down.
	Doing key bindings for these is up to the Term client.

- Implemented selection auto-scrolling for when mouse pointer moves out of
  the view. This is based on feedback from Chris Ledantec on nbui.

- Implemented SHIFT-left-click as a selection extension mechanism, per JLF.
  Actually it is slightly off in that it implements extension (what 
  you get when you drag) not addition semantics.

- bug: Term.possiblyNormalize() would occasionally cause a null Line exception.
  Fixed.

- bug: Tab expansion add's a '\0' into the buffer. On Windows this shows up 
  as as the Microsoft "unprintable character" square.
  Easily fixed in Term.OpsImpl.op_tab() by switching the ' ' character
  addition and the st.cursor.col++;

- bug: The common "null Line" bug fixed. Turns out I was using
  "synchronized(this)" in an inner class of Term.

- bug: minor bugs having to do with null'ed selections fixed. I think
  these only surfaced when I implemented absolute coordinates.

- Absolute Coordinates are in.
  What this means is that you no longer need to anchor text in order for
  Regions to work.

  The way this is accomplished is by having each line get an ever growing
  number and have Coord and ActiveRegions use these numbers for rows.

  implementation details:
  ----------------------
  To separate such "absolute" coordinates from the original buffer coordinates,
  instroduced package private class BCoord. Coord and BCoord can can be
  converted to each other. The conversion is based on 'Term.firsta' which
  is the absolute line number of the first line in thebufer. Just like
  Term.st.firstx is the buffer coordinate of the first line visible in
  the view.

  Similarly a BExtent was provided in parallel with Extent.

  Serious attention was payed to the possibility of 'firsta' wrapping around
  it's 32bit range. Ideally this could be dealt with by using unsigned numbers
  and modulo arithmetic, but Java doesn't have unsigned. Instead the variable
  is explicitly checked against Term.modulo = Integer.MAX_VALUE/2.
  The 2 is for good measure. Term.modulo can be artificially reduced to a
  small number in order to verify that selection and ActiveRegion relocation
  works correctly.

  ActiveRegions that go out of history periodically get culled.
  This is controlled using Term.cull_frequency.

- debugging aids:
  - Added a "debug gutter" Which can be used to print out view, buffer
    or absolute row coordinates.
  - Added Buffer.lock and Buffer.ck_lock() which helped me find race
    conditions. The code is commented out.

- bug: ActiveRegion.setSelectable(boolean) always set property to true. Fixed.
- bug: After the flush cleanup in term_aug2001_ivan_2 LineDispcipline's 
  eches of characters wouldn't show up until after a newline if
  the refreshEnabled property was off. Fixed by adding additional flushes.

+ Term.requestFocus() ... was missing. Added.

+ ActiveTerm.cancelRegion().
  This is supposed to help with hiliting regions that are detected only after
  the fact .. that is you aggressively call beginRegion(), like at the 
  beginning of a line, and if at the end of the line it turns out not to
  be useful you can cancel it.

- Fixed a bug where the Sun Copy key wouldn't copy things.

+ Term.flush(), TermStream.flush()
  See JavaDoc for Term.flush() for more info.

- Internal change to repaint(). 
  Term.repaint() used to always check the refreshEnabled attribute, which
  would cause things like scrolling or attribute changes not take
  immediate effect. So now we have possibly_repaint() which checks the 
  attribute and repaint() which doesn't.
  Only putChar() and putChars() use possibly_repaint().
  Made repaint() and possibly_repaint() be protected.

- AbstractInterp, InterpDumb, InterpANSI made public

- class ActiveTerm now inherits from class StreamTerm instead of class Term

+ ActiveRegion ActiveRegion.firstChild()
+ ActiveRegion ActiveRegion.getNextSibling()
+ ActiveRegion ActiveRegion.getPreviousSibling()

  To be used as follows:
	ActiveTerm at;
	r = at.regionManager().root().firstChild();
	r = r.getNextSibling()
	...
  You should be able to use Regions instead of Coords to index actions (see
  OutputTabTerm.<init>, new ActiveTermListener.

+ int Ops.op_get_width()
+ int Ops.op_get_column()

  To help with formatting and wrapping text in a Term

- The OutputStream 'pin'  parameter to StreamTerm.connect() is now optional.
  This makes sense for output only situations.

+ void Term.setTabSize(int tab_size)
+ int Term.getTabSize()
  Per NB folks' request.
  You should be able to get rid of expandTabs() in
  org/netbeans/core/output/OutputTabTerm.java.
