	    // acounting and we do it by padding the buffer (only) with a bunch of spaces.

	    // NOTE: There are two strong invariants you have to keep in mind:
	    // - Solaris, and I assume other unixes, stick to the BS-SP-BS echo
	    //   even though they seem to know about character widths.
	    // - BS from Term's point of view is _strictly_ a cursor motion operation!
	    //   The fact that it erases things has to do with the line discipline
	    //   (kernels or this class 'ere)
	    //
