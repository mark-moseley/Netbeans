A simple build tool application
===============================

BuildTool implements a simple Java build tool based on ...
	org.netbeans.lib.terminalemulator.Term
	javac

It illustrates ...
- The capabilities of ActiveTerm and how it can be used to annotate output,
  say from a build script.

To run it issue from a shell
	./buildtool
Then enter Junk.java and press Build.

A fair amount of the code has to do with the gui setup, javac Process
setup and capture of it's output. Once the output is received it is
processed line-by-line. A crude pattern is used to detect the first
line of a javac error message and a new ActiveRegion is begun, while
the previous one is ended. These active regions have their feedback
attribute set which means that they will be highlighted as the mouse
moves over them. Anyone who has had to decipher a wrapped compilation
line and error line from 'make' would appreciate this.

The sourcefilename and line number are also extracted using simple
patterns and put in their own ActiveRegions as HTML-style links, which
if clicked will bring up the right line # in some editor, or rather
fake it using a popup.

The beginning of each error message is also tagged with a simple glyph
in the "glyph gutter".

Please keep in mind that this is strictly a Term feature demo. I'm not
advocating using glyphs to tag error messasges, or that textual pattern
recognition should be used for detecting distinct error messages and
their components, nor is capturing of Process output is as trivial as it
seems here (if the demo had instead used 'make' you'd see some
reordering of output because some comes from stdout and some comes from
stderr).
