A simple telnet application
===========================

TelnetApp implements a simple telnet client based on ...
	org.netbeans.lib.terminalemulator.Term
	de.mud.jta.*
	de.mud.telnet.*

It illustrates ...
- Simple Term creation and i/o connectivity.
- Terminal emulation capabilities through setting of the terminal
  type to "ansi".

To run it issue from a shell
	./telnet <hostname>

For telnet connectivity it uses portions of
	JTA - Telnet/SSH for the JAVA(tm) platform
by Matthias L. Jugel and Marcus Meisner at
	http://javassh.org/space/start

I haven't included that stuff under CVS to avoid licensing issues since
their code is GPL, but you only need:

de/mud/jta/Wrapper.java
de/mud/telnet/ScriptHandler.java
de/mud/telnet/TelnetProtocolHandler.java
de/mud/telnet/TelnetWrapper.java

To build this demo download JTA, copy these files to a local de/ and issue 'ant'
