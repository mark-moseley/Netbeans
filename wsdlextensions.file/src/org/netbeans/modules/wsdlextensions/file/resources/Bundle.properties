OpenIDE-Module-Name=FILE WSDL Extension
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=FILE extension for wsdl editor.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=This module provides file schema and plugs into wsdl editor.
OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=CAPS
WSDLEditor/Binding/FileBinding= File Binding
WSDLEditor/BindingOperation/FileBindingOperation= File Operation
WSDLEditor/BindingOperationInput/FileBindingMessage= File Message
WSDLEditor/BindingOperationOutput/FileBindingMessage=File Message
WSDLEditor/BindingOperationFault/FileBindingOperationFault= File Operation Fault
WSDLEditor/ServicePort/FileServicePort=File Address
DESC_Element_binding="binding" indicates a file protocol based binding.
DESC_ComplexType_tOperation="operation" defines the file protocol based operation binding details.
DESC_Element_message=Defines the file transport based operation binding details.
DESC_Attribute_fileType=Defines the file type of the input file.
DESC_Attribute_fileName=Defines the file name relative to the specified directory to read from or write to. If fileNameIsPattern is not true, this attribute specifies an actual file name. Otherwise, this attribute specifies a pattern marker used for filtering input files from the directory, or a file name format to write to the directory; The supported patterns are: 1. <anyString>%d<anyString>.<anySuffix> where "%d" denotes an unique number for input and an one-up sequence number for output file names; 2. <anyString>%u<anyString>.<anySuffix> where %u denotes a wild card match for input and an UUID for output file names. 3.<anyString>%t<anyString>.<anySuffix> where %t denotes an unique timestamp for both input and out file names. The expected date format is yyyymmdd-HH-mm-ss-SSS. For input file names, the -HH-mm-ss-SSS part may be omitted if unique-ness is guaranteed. 4.<anyString>%{<seq_name>}<anyString>.<anySuffix> where %{<seq_name>} denotes an integer number in input file name or a one up sequence number persisted in a sequence file by name <seq_name> if it is for output file.
DESC_Attribute_fileNameIsPattern=Indicates whether or not the fileName attribute designates a file name pattern.
DESC_Attribute_pollingInterval=Defines the polling interval that File Binding Component searches for input files in the specified directory.  The polling interval is specified in milliseconds and has a default value of 1000ms. This attribute has no effect for writing.
DESC_Attribute_part=Defines the reference to the abstract message part in the WSDL.
DESC_Attribute_removeEOL=Defines whether or not end-of-line characters should be removed before processing. If multiple records are present, this attribute defines whether or not end-of-line characters should be removed for each record. This attribute has no effect for writing.
DESC_Attribute_addEOL=Defines whether or not end-of-line characters should be appended to the outbound message. If multiple records are present, this attribute defines whether or not end-of-line characters should be appended to each record. This attribute has no effect for reading.
DESC_Attribute_multipleRecordsPerFile=Defines whether or not the file to read from or write to the file system contains multiple records or should be considered a single payload.
DESC_Attribute_maxBytesPerRecord=Defines the maximum number of bytes to be read per record. If only single record is present, this attribute defines the total number of bytes to be read. This attribute has no effect for writing.
DESC_Attribute_recordDelimiter=Defines the record delimiter when multiple records are present. This value of this attribute is considered only if multipleRecordsPerFile is true. If no value is specified for this attribute but maxBytesPerRecord is defined when reading a file, it is assumed that each record is of fixed length with the length being the value defined for maxBytesPerRecord; Otherwise, the default record delimiter is line feed.
DESC_Attribute_archive=Indicate if archive is required for processed (read) message, when true, processed message is archived, otherwise, it is removed, default is 'false'.
DESC_Attribute_archiveDirectory=Directory where processed (read) message will be moved to, note, the message moved here is UUID tagged to avoid file name conflict in archive area, the value can be either an absolute or relative (relative to fileDirectory of <file:address>) directory, when left unspecified, 'archive' (relative to fileDirectory) is assumed.
DESC_Attribute_archiveDirIsRelative=Indicate if archiveDirectory is relative to fileDirectory in <ftp:message>, default is 'true'.
DESC_Attribute_protect=Indicate if overwrite protection is required for message write, when true, existing message will be moved to a directory before the current message is written, otherwise, existing message will be overwritten, default is 'false'.
DESC_Attribute_protectDirectory=Directory where 'in the way' message will be moved to in order to avoid being overwritten by incoming message (with same file name), note, the message moved here is UUID tagged to avoid file name conflict in protect area, the value can be either an absolute or relative (relative to fileDirectory of <file:address>) directory, when left unspecified, 'protect' (relative to fileDirectory) is assumed.
DESC_Attribute_protectDirIsRelative=Indicate if protectDirectory is relative to fileDirectory in <ftp:message>, default is 'true'.
DESC_Attribute_stage=Indicate if staging is enabled for message write, i.e. the message is written to a staging area and moved to its destination when the complete message is written, default is 'false'.
DESC_Attribute_stageDirectory=Directory for staging message write, note, the message moved here is UUID tagged to avoid being overwritten by other messages in staging area, the value can be either an absolute or relative (relative to fileDirectory of <file:address>) directory, when left unspecified, 'stage' (relative to fileDirectory) is assumed.
DESC_Attribute_stageDirIsRelative=Indicate if stageDirectory is relative to fileDirectory in <ftp:message>, default is 'true'.
DESC_Element_address="address" indicates a file protocol based service address.
DESC_Attribute_fileDirectory=Defines the directory name where WSDL provisioner should read input files from, and where client should write files to.
DESC_Attribute_relativePath=Defines whether the directory is a relative path.
DESC_Attribute_pathRelativeTo=Defines what the fileDirectory is relative to. The root path is a standard Java system property that can be read from runtime JVM settings.
DESC_Attribute_lockName=Specifies the lock file name which is created under directory as in "fileDirectory", inbound readers use the lock to synchronize their concurrent access to the target directory - "fileDirectory".
DESC_Attribute_workArea=Specifies the temp directory name where UUID tagged input files wait to be furhter processed - it is functioning as 'staging area' for inbound processing, and is relative to the target directory as in "fileDirectory"
DESC_Attribute_seqName=Specifies the file name where the current value of a persistence backed sequence number is stored, the file resides in the target directory as in "fileDirectory".
