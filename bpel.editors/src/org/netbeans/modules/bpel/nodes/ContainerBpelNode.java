/**
 * This class represents the base class for nodes which are has one specific
 * feature, which distint them from ordinal nodes.
 * They keeps the reference not to a container object, but to it's parent object.
 * <p>
 * For example, the VariableContainerNode is a container.
 * It keeps reference to BaseScope but not to the VariableContainer.
 * This behaviour is necessary to show such nodes at a tree view
 * even if they are not present at source model.
 * So a user will not ever asked to add container first and then add
 * variable. User will add variable straight away.
 * <p>
 * This method is intended to provide correct node searching.
 * See the findNode method.
 * <P>
 * This class is a generic class ans has additional generic type paramenter.
 * It specifies the type of container reference.
