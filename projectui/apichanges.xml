                <p>
                    For certain distributions of NetBeans (PHP or Ruby), actions like "Build project" or "Rebuild project" make no sense in the
                    main menu. Therefore the layer registration for these actions was moved to projectui.buildmenu module
                    which provides token "BuildActions". If a certain distribution requires these actiosn to be present it shall
                    require this token. Java and CND do now.

                <p>
         Use system property "project.tab.no.selection" for influencing the behaviour on creation or opening of projects.
         When this property is set, the opening/creating of projects doesn't trigger 
         opening and focusing of the projects logical view  top component.
         Allows the BlueJ Edition to focus it's own component instead.
                </p>

                    Added <code>RecentProjects</code> class that provides access to list of
                    recently used projects (<code>UnloadedProjectInformation</code> class). 
                    Listener can be registered to be notified about change in the 
                    list of recent projects. The API is only for friend access.
