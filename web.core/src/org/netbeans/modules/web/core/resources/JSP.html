<HTML><BODY>
This wizard creates a JSP in standard JSP syntax.
<P>
JSP technology allows you to add dynamic behaviour into otherwise
      static content by using JSP standard and custom actions (custom
      actions are also known as tags). In order to execute the dynamic
      behaviour, the JSP must run inside a JSP-enabled web container.
