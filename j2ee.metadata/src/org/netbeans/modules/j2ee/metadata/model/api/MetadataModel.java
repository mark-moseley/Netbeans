     * will still be present in the model when a subsequent invocation of
     * <code>runReadAction()</code> takes place. As a result, clients are forbidden
     * to call any methods on any piece of metadata obtained from the model outside
     * the <code>run()</code> method of an action being executed as a result of an
     * invocation of <code>runReadAction()</code>. In other words, pieces of metadata
     * that are not explicitly documented as immutable are not allowed to escape
     * the action's <code>run()</code> method.</strong></p>
     *
     * <p><strong>This method may take a long time to execute. It is
     * recommended that the method not be called from the AWT event thread. In some
     * situations, though, the call needs to be made from the event thread, such
     * as when computing the enabled state of an action. In this case it is
     * recommended that the call not take place if the {@link #isReady} method
     * returns false (and a default value be returned as the result of

     *         method. This only applies to checked exceptions; unchecked exceptions
     *         are propagated from the <code>run()</code> method unwrapped.
