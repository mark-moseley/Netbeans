 * A context holder is a component, which can provide type information in term

 * See more detailed description in the XPathSchemaContext.
 * 
 * The schema context can has a bit different meaning for different components.
 * - for Location Steps it means the schema type of the step. 
 * - for Location Paths or Expression Paths it means the schema type of the last Step.
 * - for XPath model it means the context in which the model is defined as a whole.
 * - for Predicates it means the context in which the predicate is applied.
