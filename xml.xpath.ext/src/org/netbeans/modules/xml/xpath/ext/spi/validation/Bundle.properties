XPATH_PARSING_EXCEPTION=Expression "{0}" is not valid Xpath expression. 
BAD_XPATH_EXPRESSION=Expression "{0}" is not valid Xpath expression. The initial cause is: "{1}"
UNSUPPORTED_AXIS=The location step "{0}" contains axis, which prevent fallowing type validation.
UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE=Can not find the attribute "{0}". Namespace is indefinite.
UNKNOWN_ELEMENT=Can not find the element "{0}". Namespace is indefinite.
UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE_WITH_NAMESPACE=Can not find the attribute "{0}" at the namespace "{1}".
UNKNOWN_ELEMENT_WITH_NAMESPACE=Can not find the element "{0}" at the namespace "{1}".
AMBIGUOUS_ELEMENT=There is an ambiguity while resolving the schema element "{0}". Try use qualified form (namespace prefixes).
AMBIGUOUS_ATTRIBUTE=There is an ambiguity while resolving the schema attribute "{0}". Try use qualified form (namespace prefixes).
UNKNOWN_NAMESPACE_PREFIX=The XPath contains the unknown namespace prefix "{0}".
ELEMENT_UNNECESSARY_PREFIX=The element "{0}" is unqualified and has to be without a namespace prefix.
ATTRIBUTE_UNNECESSARY_PREFIX=The attribute "{0}" is unqualified and has to be without a namespace prefix.
MISSING_NAMESPACE_PREFIX=A prefix for the namespace "{0}" is required to be declared.
MISSING_SCHEMA_IMPORT=The schema with the namespace "{0}" has to be imported.
ELEMENT_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The element "{0}" is qualified and has to have a namespace prefix.
ELEMENT_SPECIFIC_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The element "{0}" is qualified. It has to be prefixed with the "{1}".
ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The attribute "{0}" is qualified and has to have a namespace prefix.
ATTRIBUTE_SPECIFIC_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The attribute "{0}" is qualified.  It has to be prefixed with the "{1}".
GLOBAL_ELEMENT_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The global element "{0}" has to have a namespace prefix.
GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The global attribute "{0}" has to have a namespace prefix.
GLOBAL_ELEMENT_SPECIFIC_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The global element "{0}" has to be prefixed with the "{1}".
GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTE_SPECIFIC_PREFIX_REQUIRED=The global attribute "{0}" has to be prefixed with the "{1}".
UNKNOWN_EXTENSION_FUNCTION=The function "{0}" is unknown.
PREFIX_REQUIRED_FOR_EXT_FUNCTION=The function "{0}" does not have a namespace prefix. It is not found in the default or empty namespace. But functions with the same name are found in the following namespaces: {1}. Try to use a prefix before the function.
OTHER_PREFIX_REQUIRED_FOR_EXT_FUNCTION=The function "{0}" is not found in the namespace "{1}". But a function with the same name is found in the following namespaces: {2}. Try to use another prefix before the function.
ATTR_PREFIX_FROM_LIST_REQUIRED=The attribute "{0}" can correspond to different schema attributes. But all of them are qualified. So a namespace prefix requierd. The following namespaces are allowed: {1}.
ELEM_PREFIX_FROM_LIST_REQUIRED=The element "{0}" can correspond to different schema elements. But all of them are qualified. So a namespace prefix requierd. The following namespaces are allowed: {1}.
ATTR_MAYBE_PREFIX_FROM_LIST_REQUIRED=The attribute "{0}" can correspond to different schema attributes. Some of them are qualified. So maybe a namespace prefix requierd. The following namespaces are allowed: {1}.
ELEM_MAYBE_PREFIX_FROM_LIST_REQUIRED=The element "{0}" can correspond to different schema elements. Some of them are qualified. So maybe a namespace prefix requierd. The following namespaces are allowed: {1}.
ATTR_PREFIX_REDUNDANT=The attribute "{0}" can correspond to different schema attributes. All of them are unqualified. So the prefix is redundant.
ELEM_PREFIX_REDUNDANT=The element "{0}" can correspond to different schema elements. All of them are unqualified. So the prefix is redundant.
AMBIGUOUS_ABSOLUTE_PATH_BEGINNING=The first element "{0}" of the absolute path has ambiguous understanding. A namespace prefix required!.
ATTEMPT_GO_UPPER_THAN_ROOT=The location path tries to go out of a global schema element. Usually it means that the path contains redundant ".." step.
MISSING_PARENT_SCHEMA_CONTEXT=Can not resolve a schema context for a relative location path.
EXPR_CONTAINS_STUB=The XPath expression contains "{0}" stub() functions which has to be replaced with a specific argument. 
RUNTIME_NOT_SUPPORT_OPERATION=The operation "{0}" now is not supported by the runtime.
