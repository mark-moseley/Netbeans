<h2>Importing a BlueJ Project</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can work with existing BlueJ projects in the following two ways in the 
NetBeans IDE with BlueJ Module:</p>
<ul>
    <li>By opening the project in the IDE and keeping the same BlueJ
    project structure.
    <p>The advantage of this approach is that you can continue working much as you 
    have in BlueJ, but with the benefit of features in the NetBeans IDE editor.</li>
    <li>By opening the project in the IDE and then converting the project 
        into a standard NetBeans IDE Java SE project.
        <p>The advantage of this approach is that the NetBeans IDE project system 
        is more suitable for large projects. For example, you have more features in 
        the IDE for managing the classpath (such as for adding JAR files or the output of another 
        project to your classpath) and managing the way the application is built and 
        packaged. In addition, sources, unit tests, 
        and classes are placed in different folder.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<p><b>To import an existing BlueJ project into NetBeans IDE:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>In NetBeans IDE, choose File &gt; Open Project.</li>
    <li>In the Open Project dialog box, navigate to and select the folder for the 
    BlueJ project that you want to open. 
    (Project folders are indicated with the <img src="images/projectFolder.gif" alt="project folder image"> image.)
    Then click Open Project.</li>
</ol>

<p>The project opens up in the IDE. You can view the project in either the BlueJ View 
window or the IDE's standard Projects window.</p>

<p><b>To convert a BlueJ project into a NetBeans IDE project:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the BlueJ project in NetBeans IDE, as described in the procedure above.</li>
    <li>In the Projects window, right-click the project's node and choose 
    Convert to Java SE Project.</li>
</ol>
    <p>When you convert a BlueJ project into a standard Java SE project, 
    the IDE copies the sources from your existing project and places them 
    into a new project, where sources and compiled classes are separated into 
    different folders. Your BlueJ project remains, but is separate from the 
    newly created project. The converted project is not visible in the BlueJ view 
and can not be opened in BlueJ. </p> 
<p>In the converted project, you can easily manage the classpath through 
 the Libraries node. You can manage the way the application is built and packaged 
through the Project Properties dialog box, which you can open by right-clicking the project's node and choosing 
Properties.
