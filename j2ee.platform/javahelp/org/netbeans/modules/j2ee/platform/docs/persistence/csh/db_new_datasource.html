        <h2>Create Data Source Dialog Box</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small> </p>
        <p>This dialog box enables you to create a data source (JDBC resource) which 
            provides applications with a means of connecting to a database. 
            To connect to a database, the JNDI name of the data source is used to locate the associated database.
            Typically, the administrator creates a data source for each database accessed by the applications 
        deployed in a domain. (However, more than one data source can be created for a database.)</p>
        <p>To create a data source to use in your application, you need to supply the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>JNDI Name.</b> The JNDI name is the unique name for the data source. 
            The JNDI name of the data source must also be registered on the target server.
            
                <ul class="note">
                    <li>Because the data source is a JDBC resource, the JNDI name is expected in the <tt>java:comp/env/jdbc</tt> subcontext.
                For example, for a database name MyDatabase, specify <tt>jdbc/MyDatabase</tt> as the JNDI name.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Database Connection.</b> Choose the database connection to your database from the drop-down menu.
                The data source refers to a specific database connection. 
                The drop-down menu contains the database connections listed under the Databases node in the Services window.
            Choose New Database Connection to create a new database connection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you create a new data source for your application, the data source description is added to <tt>sun-resources.xml</tt> 
        under the Server Resources node of your project in the Projects window. 
        If you are deploying to the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish, 
        the data source is registered with the server upon deployment.</p>
