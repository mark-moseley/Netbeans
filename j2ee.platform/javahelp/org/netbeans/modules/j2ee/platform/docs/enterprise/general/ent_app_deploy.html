<h2>Deploying an Enterprise Application</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>Unless your EJB modules and web application modules are designed to be deployed as stand-alone modules, 
  you should always deploy them by deploying the enterprise application 
  that contains them. If you run the Run or Undeploy and Deploy commands on an individual 
  module that is part of an enterprise application, the IDE only deploys that 
  module itself. Any changes you have made in the other modules in the project are 
  not propagated to the server.</p>
  
  <p><b>To deploy an enterprise application:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Projects window, right-click the enterprise application project and 
    choose one of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Run.</b> Starts the target application server and domain, 
        deploys the enterprise application to the target application server and domain, 
        and displays it in the IDE's default browser.</li>
      <li><b>Undeploy and Deploy.</b> If already deployed, 
      stops the application and all application sessions and processes and undeploys the enterprise application. 
      The enterprise application is then deployed to the target application server and domain.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<p><b>To undeploy an enterprise application 
(Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish):</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Services window, expand the Servers node and the Sun Java System Application 
    Server/GlassFish node. 
    <ul class="note">
      <li>The server must be running and <a href="../../server/server_register.html">registered with the IDE</a>. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Expand the Applications node and the Enterprise Applications node.</li>
  <li>Right-click the enterprise applications node and choose Undeploy.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
   <li>You cannot start and stop a remote installation of a server from within the IDE.</li>
</ul>
