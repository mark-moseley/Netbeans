<h2>Setting a Proxy for Consuming a Web Service</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>

<p>If you want to access a web service, but your system is 
behind a firewall or you use a proxy server, you need to configure the IDE with your proxy settings.
For working with web services, setting a proxy can be important in one or more of the following areas:

<ul>
	<li>When retrieving the WSDL file in the Web Service Client wizard.
	<li>When using the IDE to test the web service.
	<li>When deploying to the Sun Java System Application Server.
	<li>When deploying a web service client in a Java application.
</ul>

<p>The proxy settings for each of the situations above are described below.

<p><b>To retrieve the WSDL file in the Web Service Client wizard:</b>
<p>Typically, an error such as the following is displayed in the Web Service Client wizard when the proxy settings
 for retrieving a WSDL file have
 not been set correctly:
 <p><tt>Download failed. I/O exception: (Check the proxy settings.)</tt>
<p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
<ol>
	<li>Click Proxy Settings in the Web Service Client wizard.
	<li>In the HTTP Proxy Settings window, set the proxy host and port number.</ol>
<p>The changes take effect when you click OK.


<p><b>To use the IDE to test the web service:</b>
<p>Typically, an error such as the following is returned when the proxy settings
 for testing a web service from the IDE have
 not been set correctly:
 <p><tt>org.netbeans.modules.websvc.registry.ui.ReflectionHelper.callMethodWithParams(ReflectionHelper.java:449)</tt>
<p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
<ol>
	<li>Choose Tools <img src="../../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;Options.
	<li>In the Options window, set the proxy host and port number.</ol>
<p>The changes take effect when you exit the Options window.

<p><b>To deploy to the Sun Java System Application Server:</b>
<p>Typically, an error such as the following is returned when the proxy settings
 for a web service client deployed to the Sun Java System Application Server have
 not been set correctly:
<p><tt>java.rmi.RemoteException: HTTP transport error: java.net.UnknownHostException:</tt>
<p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
<ol>
	<li>Open the Runtime window (Ctrl-5).
	<li>If the Sun Java System
	Application Server is not started, start it.
	<li>Expand Sun Java System
	Application Server's node, right-click the JVMs node, and choose Properties.
	<li>In the JVMs Properties dialog box, click JVMOptions.
	<li>Add the following properties:
	  <p><tt>-Dhttp.proxyHost=<i>your.proxy.host</tt></i>
	  <br><tt>-Dhttp.proxyPort=<i>your.proxy.port</tt></i></ol>
	  Stop and then restart the server for the new proxy settings to take effect.
<p><b>To deploy a web service client in a Java application:</b>

<p>Typically, an error such as the following is returned when the proxy settings
for a web service client deployed from a Java application have
 not been set correctly:
<p><tt>java.rmi.RemoteException: HTTP transport error: java.net.UnknownHostException:</tt>
<p>Do the following to check and set the proxy:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the Java application project node in the Projects window
	 and choose Properties.
	 <li>In the Project Properties dialog box, click Run.
	 <li>Add the following properties to the VM Options field:
	 <p><tt>-Dhttp.proxyHost=<i>your.proxy.host</i></tt> <tt>-Dhttp.proxyPort=<i>your.proxy.port</i></tt></ol>

 <p>The changes take effect when you click OK.
 <p>Note that for client deployment from Java applications, you must set the proxy for each project, because
 each Java application runs as a standalone JVM process and each can provide different JVM parameters. For web
 applications sharing the same instance of the Sun Java System Application Server, you need set the proxy only once --
  on the server itself, as described above.
