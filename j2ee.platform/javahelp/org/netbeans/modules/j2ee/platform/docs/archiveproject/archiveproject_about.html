    <h2>About Packaged Archive Projects</h2>
    <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
    <p>If you have a Java EE application that you need to deploy to a server 
    different from the server for which the application was developed, you might need to make 
    some adjustments to that application.</p>
    <p>The IDE provides the Packaged Archive project type to simplify this redeployment 
    process. A packaged archive project is based on an existing binary archive file, such as a JAR file, 
    a WAR file, or an EAR file. Assuming the application and server are both Java EE-compliant, 
    you do not need to change any Java source code before redeploying the application.</p>
    <p>Packaged archive projects have the following advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You do not have to have the original sources for the project.</li>
        <li>The application on which you base the archive project does not have to 
        have been developed in IDE.</li>
        <li>When you build a packaged archive project, a new archive is generated. 
        The copy of the archive on which you base the project is not affected.
    </ul>
    <p>When you create a packaged archive project, the IDE creates a new project that 
    contains the following files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>New copies of important configuration files, such as 
        deployment descriptors and archive manifests. 
        <p>You can view these file's 
        in the Projects window by expanding the project's Config Files node.</p>
        <p>If the 
        configuration files belong to an archive file that is packaged within 
        the archive file that the project is based on, you can find them 
        by expanding the Config node for that archive file. (For example, if you 
        packaged archive project is based on an EAR file, you would have two 
        or more sub-archive files, such as WAR files or EJB JAR files.)</p></li>
        <li>A <tt>setup</tt> folder (represented by the Server Resources node in the Projects window) 
        that can contain items such as JDBC connection pools, JMS resources, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After you have created the packaged archive project, you can do the following things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete or modify the existing configuration files and resource files as necessary.</li>
        <li>Add new configuration and resource files as required by the server to which 
        you are deploying.</li>
        <li>Repackage the archive by right-clicking the packaged archive project's 
        node and choosing Build.</li>
        <li>Verify the Java EE-compliance of the project by right-clicking the 
        project's node and choosing Verify.</li>
        <li>Deploy the repackaged application to the new server by right-clicking 
        the project's node and choosing Deploy.</li>
        <li>Change the application server to which you want to deploy by opening 
        the Project Properties dialog box and changing the Server property.</li>
    </ul>
