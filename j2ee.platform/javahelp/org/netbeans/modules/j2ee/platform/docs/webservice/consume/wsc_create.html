        <h2>Creating a  Web Service Client</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>A web service can be consumed in a web application, a Java application, or
        a MIDP client (MIDlet). For information on consuming web services 
        in a MIDlet, see the J2ME Mobility documentation.</p>

        <p>For JAX-WS clients, all imported WSDL files and schemas are
        resolved automatically by the IDE. For JAX-RPC clients,
        before you begin, note that if the WSDL file that you want to use imports schemas, other WSDL files, or both, from the local file system, the web service client will only work
        if the imported schemas and WSDL files are copied beforehand into the <tt>WEB-INF/wsdl</tt> (or <tt>META-INF/wsdl</tt>)
        folder. If you do not do this,
        the <a href="../build/about_wscompile.html">Web Service Compiler</a>
        will not be able to locate these imported files at the end of the procedure below.

        <p><b>To create a web service client:</b>
	
        <ol>
            <li>Create the project to contain the web service client. Depending on how you want to
            consume the web service, do one of the following:
            <ul><li><a href="../../web/create/about/create_webapps_proj.html">Create a web application project</a>.
            </li>
                <li><a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/project/csh/proj_j2se-standapp_wiz.html">Create a Java application project</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>From the Projects window or Files window, right-click a node
            in the project and choose New &gt; File/Folder.
            The New File wizard appears. Under Categories, select Web Services. Under File Types, select Web Service Client.
            Click Next.</li>
            <li>Access the WSDL file of the web service that the web service client is to consume.
            Depending on what the provider has distributed, do the following:<ul>
                <li>To generate a client from a project
                on your local filesystem, click Project and browse to a project's
                web service port icon.</li>            
                <li>To generate a client from a WSDL file
                on your local filesystem, click Local File and browse to the WSDL file on
                your local filesystem.</li>
                <li>To generate a client from a running web service, click WSDL URL,
                    then type or paste the web service's URL.
                    If you are behind a corporate firewall, click Proxy Settings and
                    set your proxy host and port number.
                    <ul class="note">
                        <li>The WSDL file is downloaded when you finish the wizard.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Specify a package where the client files are to be generated. When you complete
            the wizard, you can find the generated client files in the Files window, within the
            <tt>build</tt> folder. See <a href="wsc_expose.html">Exposing the Web Service Client in the Projects Window</a>.
            <li>For JAX-RPC (J2EE 1.4) clients, select the web service client type from the Client Type drop-down:
                <ul><li><b>J2EE Container-generated static stub.</b> 
                    This type is based on JSR-109, which enhances JSR-101 by defining the packaging
                    of web services into standard J2EE modules, including a new deployment descriptor,
                    and defining web services that are implemented as session beans or servlets.
                    This is the recommended and portable (via J2EE 1.4 specification) type.
                    When you choose this type, the IDE adds deployment information in the 
                    deployment descriptors and the container generates the stub and other artifacts.</li>
                    <li><b>IDE-generated static stub.</b> 
                    Only available for JAX-WS (J2EE 1.4) web services.
                    This type is based on JAX-RPC, which defines the mapping of WSDL to Java and vice versa.
                    It also defines a client API to invoke a remote web service and a runtime environment 
                    on the server to host a web service. This type is not portable.
                    When you choose this type, the IDE generates 
                    the stub and other 
                    artifacts, packages them in the archive, and deploys them.</li>
                    <ul class="note">
                        <li>If a web service is consumed in a Java application, no J2EE application server
                        is used. The application runs as a stand-alone JVM process and its
                        JVM parameters are set per project. Therefore, the J2EE Container-generated
                        static stub does not apply to Java applications and is not made available in the Client Type
                        drop-down.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>For J2SE clients, use the JAX Version drop-down to
                specify whether you want to create a JAX-WS client
                or a JAX-RPC client.
            </li>

            <li>Click Finish.</li>
