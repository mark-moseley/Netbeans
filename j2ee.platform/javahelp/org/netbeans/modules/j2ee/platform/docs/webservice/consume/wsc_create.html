<h2>Creating a  Web Service Client</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>A web service can be consumed in a web application, a Java application, or
a MIDP client (MIDlet). For information on consuming web services 
in a MIDlet, see the J2ME Mobility documentation.</p>

<p>Before you begin, note that if the WSDL file that you want to use imports schemas, other WSDL files, or both, from the local file system, the web service client will only work
	if the imported schemas and WSDL files are copied beforehand into the <tt>WEB-INF/wsdl</tt> (or <tt>META-INF/wsdl</tt>)
       	folder. If you do not do this,
	the <a href="../build/about_wscompile.html">Web Service Compiler</a>
       	will not be able to locate these imported files at the end of the procedure below.

<p><b>To create a web service client:</b>
	
<ol>
	<li>Create the project to contain the web service client. Depending on how you want to
        consume the web service, do one of the following:
	<ul><li><a href="../../web/create/about/create_webapps_proj.html">Create a web application project</a>.
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top"> 
<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>Later, you will not be able to <a href="wsc_build.html">build</a> the web service client
	unless the Sun Java System Application Server is the target
	server for the project. Therefore, take the appropriate steps to 
	<a href="../create/set_ws_server.html">prepare to develop web services and clients</a>.</td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li><a href="nbdocs:/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/project/csh/proj_j2se-standapp_wiz.html">Create a Java application project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>From the Projects window or Files window, right-click a node
in the project and choose New &gt; File/Folder.
The New File wizard appears. Under Categories, select Web Services. Under File Types, select Web Service Client.
 Click Next.</li>
<li>Access the WSDL file of the web service that the web service client is to consume.
 Depending on what the provider has distributed, do the following:<ul>
	<li>To generate a client from a running web service, type or paste the web service's URL.
       	If you are behind a corporate firewall, click Proxy Settings and
	set your proxy host and port number. Click Retrieve WSDL.

<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>The WSDL file is successfully downloaded when the IDE fills Local Filename field with
	the name of a WSDL file, such as <tt>CountCheatService.asmx.wsdl</tt>.</td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li>To generate a client from a WSDL file
on your local filesystem, click Existing WSDL File and browse to the WSDL file on
your local filesystem.</li></ul>
 <li>Specify a package where the client files are to be generated. When you complete
  the wizard, you can find the generated client files in the Files window, within the
  <tt>build</tt> folder. See <a href="wsc_expose.html">Exposing the Web Service Client in the Projects Window</a>.
   <li>Select the web service client type from the Client Type drop-down:
<ul><li><b>J2EE Container-generated static stub.</b> 
This type is based on JSR-109, which enhances JSR-101 by defining the packaging
of web services into standard J2EE modules, including a new deployment descriptor,
and defining web services that are implemented as session beans or servlets.
This is the recommended and portable (via J2EE 1.4 specification) type.
When you choose this type, the IDE adds deployment information in the 
 deployment descriptors and the container does the generation of the stub and other artifacts.</li>
 <li><b>IDE-generated static stub.</b> 
This type is based on JSR-101, which defines the mapping of WSDL to Java and vice versa.
It also defines a client API to invoke a remote web service and a runtime environment 
on the server to host a web service. This type is not portable.
When you choose this type, the IDE generates 
the stub and other 
artifacts, packages them in the archive, and deploys them.</li>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top"> 
<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>If a web service is consumed in a Java application, no J2EE application server
	 is used. The application runs as a standalone JVM process and its
	 JVM parameters are set per project. Therefore, the J2EE Container-generated
  static stub does not apply to Java applications and is not made available in the Client Type
 drop-down.</td>
</tr>
</table></ul>
</li>

<li>Click Finish.</li>

 
<p>The IDE creates a node for the web service under the Web Service References node in the Projects window.
For each web service operation defined in the WSDL file, the IDE creates a sub-node with the 
operation's name. You can right-click an operation node and choose Test Operation to test the operation directly within 
the IDE, without writing a single line of code. In addition, the IDE does the following:
<ul><li>Creates a folder, if not already present, named <tt>wsdl</tt> under <tt>web/WEB-INF</tt> to contain the WSDL file.</li>
<li>Adds a <tt>service-ref</tt> element to the deployment descriptor (the <tt>web.xml</tt> file) for this service.</li>
<li>Adds a <tt>wscompile</tt> target for this service to the Ant build script (the <tt>build.xml</tt> file).</li>
    <li>Shows the service in the Web Service registry in the Runtime tab.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
