<h2>New Web Service Client Wizard</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>The New Web Service Client wizard creates a new <a href="../../consume/about_wsc.html">Web Service Client</a>.
 You open the New Web Service Client wizard by right-clicking a web application or
 Java application, choosing New &gt; File/Folder and selecting Web Service Client 
  from the Web Services category.
<p>In the Specify Web Service Client Information page, you have to set the following properties: 
<ul>
	<li>Source of the WSDL description:
	<ul><li><b>Running Web Service. </b>Specifies the URL to a running web service's WSDL file. If you
		 use a proxy server, you must click Proxy Settings and set the proxy host and port number,
		  otherwise the IDE will not be able to download the WSDL file. Click Retrieve WSDL and, if
		   the WSDL file's name automatically appears in the Local Filename field, the WSDL file
		   is successfully downloaded.</li>
		<li><b>Existing WSDL File. </b>Specifies a WSDL file in your local filesystem. Click Browse
		 to locate it in your filesystem.</li></ul>
  <li><b>Package.</b> Specifies the package where the client stubs and other artifacts will be generated.
  Note that you will not be able to see this package and the client files in the Projects window, because they are
   re-generated whenever you build the project and deleted when you clean the project. Files of this
   nature are never displayed in the Projects window by default. To override this behavior and display
    the client files in the Projects window anyway, right-click the project node, choose Properties,
     and use the Sources panel to add the package containing the client files. The package will then
      be displayed in the Projects window, but beware of creating files in this package, because the
      IDE will re-generate it when the project is built and delete it when the project is cleaned.</li>
  <li><b>Client Type.</b> Specifies the type of client stubs that will be created by the wizard.
<ul><li><b>J2EE Container-generated static stub.</b> 
This type is based on JSR-109, which enhances JSR-101 by defining the packaging
of web services into standard J2EE modules, including a new deployment descriptor,
and defining web services that are implemented as session beans or servlets.
This is the recommended and portable (via J2EE 1.4 specification) type.
When you choose this type, the IDE adds deployment information in the 
 deployment descriptors and the container does the generation of the stub and other artifacts.</li>
 <li><b>IDE-generated static stub.</b> 
This type is based on JSR-101, which defines the mapping of WSDL to Java and vice versa.
It also defines a client API to invoke a remote web service and a runtime environment 
on the server to host a web service. This type is not portable.
When you choose this type, the IDE generates 
the stub and other 
artifacts, packages them in the archive, and deploys them.</li></ul>
