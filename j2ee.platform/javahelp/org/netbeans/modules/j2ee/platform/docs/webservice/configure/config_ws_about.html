        <h2>About Configuring Web Services</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>You configure your web services at several different levels.</p>
        <h3>Project Contents and Classpath</h3>
        <p>Basic project settings like the web application or EJB module's source roots and classpath are 
        set in the module's Project Properties dialog box. You open this dialog box 
        by right-clicking the project node and choosing Properties.</p>
        <p>For standard projects, you can add source roots in the Sources page of the 
        Project Properties dialog box. You can quickly add to the compilation and test 
        classpath by right-clicking the Libraries or Test Libraries node in the Projects 
        window. To further configure the classpath, or to specify which items should 
        be included in deployment, use the Libraries page of the Project Properties 
        dialog box.</p>
      
        <h3>Compilation Settings</h3>
        <p>Depending on the web service type, you configure compilation settings
        in different ways. For JAX-WS web services, you use the Web Service Attributes Editor
        to customize WSDL files. For JAX-RPC web services that
        are created from WSDL, you use the
        Project Properties dialog box to configure the <tt>wscompile</tt> tool. For details,
        see <a href="../build/about_build_ws.html">About Building Web Services</a>.</p>
        <h3>Deployment Settings</h3>
        <p>There are several key steps to configuring deployment settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Setting the target server.</b> Although the IDE only supports the Sun 
                Java Systems Application Server, you can have several instances of the server 
                registered. You can set the target server instance for a project by doing 
                any of the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifying the server in the New Project wizard when creating the project.</li>
                    <li>Going to a project's Project Properties dialog box and setting the 
                    target server in the Run page.</li>
                    <li>Adding the module that contains the web service to an enterprise application. The module is then 
                    deployed to the same server instance as the enterprise application.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Adding the project module to a J2EE application.</b> You can add a web application or EJB module 
                to an enterprise project by doing either of the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifying the enterprise application in the New Project wizard when 
                    creating the project.</li>
                    <li>Right-clicking the J2EE Modules node for any enterprise application 
                    project and choosing Add J2EE Module.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Configuring web services via annotations.</b> You only do this for JAX-WS web services (that is,
                for Java EE 5). For these web services, the IDE generates annotation snippets
                in the artifacts that it creates and lets you use code completion to fill out the
                annotation snippets.
                
            </li>
            <li><b>Configuring web services via deployment descriptors.</b> 
                In principle, you only do this
                for JAX-RPC web services (that is, J2EE 1.4).  For these web services, the IDE automatically updates 
                your deployment descriptors as you code your web service. Whenever you insert 
                a call to an enterprise bean or create select or finder methods, the IDE automatically 
                enters the necessary information in your deployment descriptors. You can manually 
                configure your deployment descriptors by expanding the EJB module's Configuration 
                Files node and double-clicking <tt>webservices.xml</tt> or the deployment descriptors applicable to the project.
          
                <p>Even though JAX-WS (Java EE 5) web services are generally configured
                via annotations, you can still continue configuring them by means of
                deployment descriptors, to override annotations. For example, a developer might
                use annotations which a deployer wants to override.
            </li>
