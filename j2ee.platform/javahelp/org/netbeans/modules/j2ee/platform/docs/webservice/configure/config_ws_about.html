<h2>About Configuring Web Services</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You configure your web services at several different levels.</p>
<h3>Project Contents and Classpath</h3>
<p>Basic project settings like the web application or EJB module's source roots and classpath are 
  set in the module's Project Properties dialog box. You open this dialog box 
  by right-clicking the project node and choosing Properties.</p>
<p>For standard projects, you can add source roots in the Sources page of the 
  Project Properties dialog box. You can quickly add to the compilation and test 
  classpath by right-clicking the Libraries or Test Libraries node in the Projects 
  window. To further configure the classpath, or to specify which items should 
  be included in deployment, use the Libraries page of the Project Properties 
  dialog box.</p>
<p>For free-form projects, there are no Libraries or Test Libraries nodes. The 
  classpath and source roots are managed completely by your project's Ant script. 
  In the Sources and Classpath pages of the Project Properties dialog, you just 
  configure the project to match the settings that already exist in your Ant script. 
  This tells the IDE which classes to offer for debugging, code completion, and 
  so forth.</p>
<h3>Deployment Settings</h3>
<p>There are several key steps to configuring deployment settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Setting the target server.</b> Although the IDE only supports the Sun 
    Java Systems Application Server, you can have several instances of the server 
    registered. You can set the target server instance for a project by doing 
    any of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>Specifying the server in the New Project wizard when creating the project.</li>
      <li>Going to a project's Project Properties dialog box and setting the 
        target server in the Run page.</li>
      <li>Adding the module that contains the web service to an enterprise application. The module is then 
        deployed to the same server instance as the enterprise application.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Adding the project module to a J2EE application.</b> You can add a web application or EJB module 
    to an enterprise project by doing any of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>Specifying the enterprise application in the New Project wizard when 
        creating the project.</li>
      <li>Right-clicking the J2EE Modules node for any enterprise application 
        project and choosing Add J2EE Module.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Configuring deployment descriptors.</b> The IDE automatically updates 
  your deployment descriptors as you code your web service. Whenever you insert 
    a call to an enterprise bean or create select or finder methods, the IDE automatically 
    enters the necessary information in your deployment descriptors. You can manually 
    configure your deployment descriptors by expanding the EJB module's Configuration 
    Files node and double-clicking <tt>webservices.xml</tt> or the deployment descriptors applicable to the project.</li>
</ul>
