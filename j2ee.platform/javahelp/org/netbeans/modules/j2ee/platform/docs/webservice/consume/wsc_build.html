    <h2>Building a Web Service Client</h2>
    <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
    <p>In general, you build a web service client implemented within a Java application
        or a web application just as you would build any other 
        project. As with other projects, the IDE automatically detects whether a project is part of a J2EE application 
        and sets whether to package the archive files on the classpath accordingly.
        You can adjust which archive files are packaged with your module in the 
    module project's Project Properties dialog box.</p>
    
    <p><b>To build the web service client:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the module within which the web service client is implemented
            is part of a J2EE application, make sure the J2EE application 
            is set as the main project and choose Build &gt; Build 
        Main Project (F11).</li>
        <li>If the project is a stand-alone module, or if you want to build the 
            module without building the other modules in the J2EE application, right-click 
        the project's node in the Projects window and choose Build Project.</li>
    </ul></li>
