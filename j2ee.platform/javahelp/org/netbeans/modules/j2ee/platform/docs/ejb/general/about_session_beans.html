<h2>About Session Beans</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A session bean is an enterprise bean that provides a service to a particular 
  user session. A session bean is typically created when the session needs one. Relative to 
  entity beans, session beans are short-lived. A session bean can be one of two 
  types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Stateless.</b> The bean does not save state information during its conversation 
    with the user. These enterprise beans are useful for simple interactions between 
    client and application service, interactions that are complete in a single 
    method invocation. 
    <p>An example is an enterprise bean that processes orders. Each order can 
      be processed by an invocation of one method, such as <tt>processOrder()</tt>. 
      All the information needed for processing is contained in the method parameters.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Stateful.</b> The bean saves state information during its conversation 
    with the user. These enterprise beans are useful for business processes that 
    require an interaction between client and application service that lasts longer 
    than a single method invocation and requires memory of the state of the interaction. 
    <p>An example is an online shopping cart. The end user, through the client 
      program, can order a number of items. The stateful session bean managing 
      the interaction must accumulate items until the end user is ready to review 
      the accumulated order, approve or reject items, and initiate processing 
      of the lot. The stateful session bean has to store the unprocessed items 
      and enable the end user to add more.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Interfaces</h3>
<p>Like all entity beans, session beans can have local interfaces, remote interfaces, 
  or both. Session beans are more likely to have remote interfaces than entity 
  beans and message-driven beans, since they are usually the entry point for access 
  from remote clients.</p>
<p>The interfaces handle client access to the session bean's methods. Modules 
  that are included in the same enterprise application as the EJB module can access 
  the session bean's modules through its local interfaces. Modules that are not 
  in the same enterprise application must access the bean's methods through its 
  remote interfaces.</p>
