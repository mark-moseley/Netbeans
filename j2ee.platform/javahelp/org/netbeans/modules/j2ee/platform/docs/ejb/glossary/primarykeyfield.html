<h6>primary key field</h6>
<p>A persistent field of an entity bean that maps to a primary key in a database, 
  a key that uniquely identifies a record in the database. An entity bean must 
  have at least one primary key field. Because a primary key can be composed of 
  more than one field, an entity bean can also have more than one primary 
  key field.</p>
