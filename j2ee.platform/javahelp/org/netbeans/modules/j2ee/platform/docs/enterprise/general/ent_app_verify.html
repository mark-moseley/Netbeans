<h2>Verifying an Enterprise Application</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
<p>Before you deploy an enterprise application or any stand-alone web or EJB module, you
 should verify it, to ensure it is properly implemented to the J2EE 1.4 specification.
 The verifier tool validates both J2EE and SJS Application Server specific deployment descriptors against their corresponding DTD files 
  and gives errors and warnings if a module or application is not J2EE and SJS Application Server compliant. You can verify deployment descriptors 
  in EAR, WAR, RAR, and JAR files.</p>
<p>The verifier tool is not simply an XML syntax verifier. Rules and interdependencies 
  between various elements in the deployment descriptors are verified. Where needed, 
  classes in your module are examined to ensure that what is referred to in the
  deployment descriptors actually exists and will work when deployed. </p>
<p><b>To verify a project deployment descriptors:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>Right-click any web application module, EJB module, or enterprise application project 
    in the Projects window and choose Verify. 
    <p>The Verifier window opens and displays all the results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Filter the results according to your needs: 
    <ul>
      <li>Click Failures Only to display only failures.</li>
      <li>Click Failures and Warnings Only to display only failures and warnings.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Make appropriate changes, if any, and verify the project again.</li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
  <li>Not all failures to comply with the J2EE 1.4 specification will cause the 
  application to fail. However, modules that fail to comply with the J2EE 1.4 specification
   may not be portable between application servers. The verifier tool helps you ensure your code is
    not locked into running only on a specific application server.</li>
</ul>
