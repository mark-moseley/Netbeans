<p>Right-click the project and choose one of the 
    following: 
    <ul><li><b>Run Project.</b> Only takes the 
	    minimal steps needed to run the project. For example, if you only changed one file,
	    only that file is sent to the server.
	    </li>
      <li><b>Deploy Project.</b> Undeploys and then deploys the complete module 
        no matter what changes you made, even if none.</li>
    </ul>
  

<p>For web applications, unless the project in which the web service 
  client is implemented is designed to be deployed as a stand-alone application, you 
  should always deploy it by deploying the enterprise application that contains 
  it. If you run the Run Project or Deploy Project commands on an individual module 
  that is part of an enterprise application, the IDE only deploys that module 
  itself. Any changes you have made in the other modules in the project are not 
  propagated to the server.</p>

  <p><b>To deploy a client from within an enterprise application project:</b></p>
  <ol>
	  <li>In the Projects window, <a href="../../web/configure/about_webapp_configure.html">add the web application module</a>
	   to the enterprise application.</li>
  <li>Right-click the enterprise application project and choose one of the 
    following: 
    <ul>
	    <li><b>Run Project.</b> Only takes the 
	    minimal steps needed to run the project. For example, if you only changed one file,
	    only that file is sent to the server.</li>
      <li><b>Deploy Project.</b> Undeploys and then deploys the complete module 
        no matter what changes you made, even if none.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  
<p><b>Troubleshooting</b>
<ol>
<li><a href="wsc_test.html">Test the web service from the IDE</a> to make sure it is available.
<li>Check your proxy settings, if error messages such as the following are returned:

<p><tt>java.rmi.RemoteException: HTTP transport error: java.net.UnknownHostException:</tt></p>

<p>For details, see <a href="wsc_proxy.html">Setting a Proxy for Consuming a Web Service</a>.</ol>
