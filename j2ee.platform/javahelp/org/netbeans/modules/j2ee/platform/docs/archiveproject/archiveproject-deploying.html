    <h2>Redeploying an Application to a Different Server</h2>
    <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
    <p>If you need to redeploy a Java EE application to a different server, you can 
    easily create a new archive that is deployable to the other server. You can do 
    so using the IDE's Packaged Archive project template.</p>
    <p>To create a Packaged Archive project, you only need the deployable archive file 
    (such as an EAR file, an 
    EJB JAR file, or a WAR file). You do not need the application's sources. Also, 
    it is <i>not</i> necessary to have developed the application in the IDE.</p>
    <p>You can then configure that project for deploying the application on the other server. For 
    example, you might have to modify deployment descriptor files.
    Then you can create a new archive 
    file and deploy the file to the other server.</p>

    <p><b>To redeploy a project to a different server:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that you have the server registered in the IDE's Server Manager.
            <p>If you do not have the server registered, choose Tools &gt; Server Manager and register the server.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Choose New &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N).
        <p>The New Project wizard appears.</p>
        <li>Select the Enterprise category, select the 
        Packaged Archive template, and click Next.</li>
        <li>In the second page of the wizard, fill in the following fields:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Project Name.</b> The name for your project as it will appear in the Projects window.</li>
                <li><b>Project Location.</b> The location where the project will be stored on your system.</li>
                <li><b>Archive File.</b> The JAR file, WAR file, EAR file, or other binary 
                archive file on which you are basing the project.</li>
                <li><b>Target Server.</b> The server to which you plan to deploy the 
                repackaged archive file.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Click Finish to exit the wizard.</li>
        <li>As necessary, add, modify, and delete the configuration files for the 
        archive file. For example, you probably need to delete a server-specific deployment 
        descriptor and create a new deployment descriptor that is specific to the server 
        to which you will redeploy.
        <p>You can find these files by opening the Projects window and 
        expanding the node for the newly created project. The files are grouped 
        within the Server Resources and Config Files nodes. If the project 
        contains sub-archives, Config nodes for those sub-archives also appear.</p>
        <p>You can add server resources and other configuration files by right-clicking 
        the project's node and choosing from a template in the New submenu.</p></li>
        <li>Build the project by right-clicking the project's node and choosing Build.</li>
        <li>Verify the Java EE compliance of the changed files by right-clicking 
        the project's node and choosing Verify.</li>
        <li>Deploy the application to the new server by right-clicking the 
        project's node and choosing Deploy.</li>
    </ol>
