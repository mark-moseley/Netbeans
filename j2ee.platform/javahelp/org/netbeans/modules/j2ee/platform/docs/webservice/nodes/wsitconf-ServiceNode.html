        <h2>Web Service Attributes Editor: Port Binding</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>In the WSIT tab's Port Binding section, on the service side, 
        you can configure <a href="../about/wsitconf-mtom.html">MTMOM</a>, 
        <a href="../about/wsitconf-reliability.html">reliable messaging</a>, and interoperable
        <a href="../about/wsitconf-security_policy.html">security policy</a>.</p>
        <p>You can set the following options:</p>        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Optimize Transport of Binary Data (MTOM).</b> When you expand the MTOM section, 
            you can select the MTOM checkbox.
            The MTOM feature is disabled in JAX-WS by default. It can be enabled on the
            client and server. Once enabled all the XML binary data, XML elements of type
            xs:base64Binary and xs:hexBianry is optimally transmitted. Currently MTOM
            works only with proxy port.
            <li><b>Reliable Message Delivery.</b> Specifies whether reliable messaging is enabled.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Deliver Messages In Exact Order.</b> Specifies whether the Reliable Messaging protocol ensures that the
                application messages for a given message sequence are delivered
                to the endpoint application in the order indicated by the message
                numbers. This option increases the time to process
                application message sequences and may result in
                the degradation of Web service performance.
                <li><b>Advanced.</b> Click the Advanced button
                to set the following options:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Flow Control.</b> Specifies whether the Flow Control feature is enabled.
                    <li><b>Maximum Flow Control Buffer Size.</b> If Flow control is enabled, 
                    specifies the number of messages for a
                    sequence that will be buffered. The default setting is 32.
                    <li><b>Inactivity Timeout (ms).</b> Specifies the time interval beyond which either source or destination
                    may terminate any message sequence due to inactivity. The
                    default setting is 600,000 milliseconds (10 minutes). A Web service
                    endpoint will always terminate a sequence whose inactivity
                    timeout has expired. To keep the sequence active, an inactive client
                    will always send a stand- alone message with an AckRequested
                    header to act as a heartbeat as the end Inactivity timeout interval
                    approaches.
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Secure All Service Operations.</b> Specifies WSIT security
            for all of the operations of a web service.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Secure All Service Operations.</b> Select one of the options from the list. Most of
                the mechanisms are fully functional without further configuration,
                however, if you’d like to customize the mechanism, click Configure
                to specify the configuration for that mechanism. For details on each
                security mechanism, see <a href="../about/wsitconf-about_security_mechanism_options.html">About Security Mechanism Options for Web Services</a>.
                <p>The mechanisms
                that use STS require that an STS be specified in the Configuration
                dialog. If a security mechanism is
                selected that requires this, select the buttons to configure keystore,
                truststore, and validator options.
                <li><b>Act As Secure Token Service (STS).</b>If you want to enable this web service to
                act as an STS, select this option. An STS contains a set of interfaces
                to be used for the issuance, exchange, and validation of security
                tokens.
            </ul>
            <li><b>Allow TCP Transport.</b> Specifies that the service supports
            TCP and works with both TCP and HTTP transport. TCP provides better
            performance when sending smaller messages. The performance
            enhancement is visible mostly in smaller messages because the overhead
            of sending messages over the HTTP protocol is eliminated.
            <li><b>Allow Fast Infoset.</b> Specifies that Fast Infoset is used for faster parsing,
            faster serializing, and smaller document sizes when compared with
            equivalent XML documents.
        </ul>
