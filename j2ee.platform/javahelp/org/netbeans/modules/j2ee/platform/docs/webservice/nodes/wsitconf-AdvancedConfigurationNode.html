        <h2>Web Service Attributes Editor: Advanced Configuration</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>The Advanced Configuration section of the Web Service Attributes editor
        is part of the <a href="../about/wsitconf-security.html">security</a> features provided by
        <a href="../nodes/wsitconf-about.html">Quality of Service</a>.
         
        <p>When you expand the Advanced Configuration section, you find the following
            fields:
            <ul>
                <li><b>RM Resend Interval (ms).</b> The time in millisconds
                after which the sender (RMSource) resends unacknowledged messages
                to the receiver (RM Destination) . By default, resends happen every
                2000ms. 
                <li><b>RM Close Timeout (ms).</b> By default, the call to 
                <tt>proxy.close()</tt> will not return until all messages 
                have been acknowledged. RM close timeout is the interval 
                (in milliseconds) that the client runtime will block waiting 
                for a call to <tt>close()</tt> to return.
                If there are still unacknowledged messages after this interval
                is reached, and the call to close has returned, 
                an error will be logged about messages being lost. 
                <li><b>RM Ack Request Interval (ms).</b> The suggested minimum time 
                that the sender (RMSource) should allow to elapse between Acknowledgement
                requests to the receiver (RMDestination).
                <li><b>Secure Session Token Lifetime (ms).</b> 
                <li><b>Renew Expired Secure Session Tokens.</b> 
                <li><b>Require Cancel of Secure Session.</b> 
            </ul>
        </p>
