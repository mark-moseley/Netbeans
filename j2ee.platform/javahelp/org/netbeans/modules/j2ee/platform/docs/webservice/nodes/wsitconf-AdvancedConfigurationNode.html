        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>The Advanced Configuration section of the Web Service Attributes editor
        is part of the <a href="../about/wsitconf-security.html">security</a> features provided by the
        <a href="../about/wsitconf-about.html">Quality of Service</a>.
         
        <p>When you expand the Advanced Configuration section, you find the following
            fields:
            <ul>
                <li><b>RM Resend Interval (ms).</b> The time in millisconds
                after which the sender (RMSource) resends unacknowledged messages
                to the receiver (RM Destination) . By default, resends happen every
                2000ms. 
                <li><b>RM Close Timeout (ms).</b> By default, the call to 
                <tt>proxy.close()</tt> will not return until all messages 
                have been acknowledged. RM close timeout is the interval 
                (in milliseconds) that the client runtime will block waiting 
                for a call to <tt>close()</tt> to return.
                If there are still unacknowledged messages after this interval
                is reached, and the call to close has returned, 
                an error will be logged about messages being lost. 
                <li><b>RM Ack Request Interval (ms).</b> The time in milliseconds
                after which the sender (RMSource) asks the receiver (RMDestination) 
                to  acknowledge the messages it has received. By default, the 
                sender asks for acknowledgements with every application message.
                However, if a positive value is given, then the sender will wait
                for this interval before which it will request an acknowledgement.
                <li><b>Secure Session Token Lifetime (ms).</b> 
                <li><b>Renew Expired Secure Session Tokens.</b> 
                <li><b>Require Cancel of Secure Session.</b> 
            </ul>
        </p>
