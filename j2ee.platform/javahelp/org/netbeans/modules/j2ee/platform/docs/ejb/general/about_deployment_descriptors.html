<h2>About Deployment Descriptors</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Deployment descriptors are XML-based text files whose elements describe how 
  to assemble and deploy a module to a specific environment. The elements also 
  contain behavioral information about components not included directly in code. 
</p>
<p>Deployment descriptors specify two kinds of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Structural information describes the different components of the JAR (or 
    EAR) file, their relationship with each other, and their external dependencies. 
    Environment entries and resource requirements are part of the structural information. 
  </li>
  <li>Assembly information describes how contents of a JAR (or EAR) file can be 
    composed into a deployable unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different types of deployment descriptors: EJB deployment descriptors 
  described in the Enterprise JavaBeans specification, web deployment descriptors 
  described in the Servlet specification, and application and application client 
  deployment descriptors described in the Java EE specification. For each type of 
  module or application, there are two deployment descriptors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A general deployment descriptor that configures deployment settings on any 
    Java EE-compliant implementation. The general deployment descriptor is named 
    <tt><i>moduleType</i>.xml</tt> (for example, <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> for EJB 
    modules and <tt>web.xml</tt> for web application modules.)</li>
  <li>A server-specific deployment descriptor that configures deployment settings 
    for a specific server implementation. For example, the deployment descriptors 
    for the Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish are named <tt>sun-<i>moduleType</i>.xml</tt>. 
    The deployment descriptor for the Tomcat Web Server is named <tt>context.xml</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deployment Descriptors in the IDE</h3>
<p>The IDE generates a deployment descriptor from the settings for EJB modules, 
  web application modules, and enterprise applications, when you create an empty enterprise project. 
  It also reads your existing deployment descriptors when you import existing 
  enterprise beans, enterprise applications, and web applications into the IDE. 
  The deployment descriptors are located in the <tt>conf</tt> folder of your project directory, 
  and are displayed under the Configuration Files node in the Projects window.</p>
<p>As you work with your projects, the IDE updates the general deployment descriptors 
  to reflect changes you have made, such as adding business methods to an enterprise 
  bean or adding a web application module to an enterprise application. </p>
<p>The IDE also automatically updates your server-specific deployment descriptors 
  if the target server is the Tomcat Web Server or the Sun Java System Application 
  Server/GlassFish. For all other application servers, you have to write the deployment 
  descriptors yourself.</p>
<p>You can open a graphical editor for a deployment descriptor by double-clicking 
  its node in the Projects window. You can edit the deployment descriptor's XML 
  by right-clicking its node and choosing Edit.</p>
<p>The IDE also automatically registers the DTDs and schemas for all the Java EE 
  deployment descriptors, as well as the Sun Java System Application Server DTDs. 
  You can therefore check and validate the XML in your deployment descriptors 
  according to the DTDs and schemas. You can view the DTDs by choosing Tools &gt; DTDs and XML Schemas
  from the main menu.</p>
