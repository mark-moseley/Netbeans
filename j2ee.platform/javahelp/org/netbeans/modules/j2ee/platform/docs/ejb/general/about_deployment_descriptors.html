<h2>About Deployment Descriptors</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Deployment descriptors are XML-based text files whose elements describe how 
  to assemble and deploy a module to a specific environment. The elements also 
  contain behavioral information about components not included directly in code. 
</p>
<p>Deployment descriptors specify two kinds of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Structural information describes the different components of the JAR (or 
    EAR) file, their relationship with each other, and their external dependencies. 
    Environment entries and resource requirements are part of the structural information. 
  </li>
  <li>Assembly information describes how contents of a JAR (or EAR) file can be 
    composed into a deployable unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different types of deployment descriptors: EJB deployment descriptors 
  described in the Enterprise JavaBeans specification, web deployment descriptors 
  described in the Servlet specification, and application and application client 
  deployment descriptors described in the J2EE specification. For each type of 
  module or application, there are two deployment descriptors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A general deployment descriptor that configures deployment settings on any 
    J2EE-compliant implementation. The general deployment descriptor is named 
    <tt><i>moduleType</i>.xml</tt> (for example, <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> for EJB 
    modules and <tt>web.xml</tt> for web modules.)</li>
  <li>A server-specific deployment descriptor that configures deployment settings 
    for a specific J2EE-compliant implementation. The deployment descriptors for 
    the SJS Application Server are named <tt>sun-<i>moduleType</i>.xml</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deployment Descriptors in the IDE</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;IDE generates a deployment descriptor from the settings for EJB modules, 
  web modules, and J2EE applications.when you create an empty enterprise project. 
  It also reads your existing deployment descriptors when you import existing 
  enterprise beans, enterprise applications, and web applications into the IDE. 
  The deployment descriptors are located in the conf folder of your project directory, 
  and are displayed under the Configuration Files node in the Projects window.</p>
<p>As you work with your projects, the IDE updates the deployment descriptors 
  to reflect changes you have made, such as adding business methods to an enterprise 
  bean or adding a web module to an enterprise application. You can open a graphical 
  editor for a deployment descriptor by double-clicking its node in the Projects 
  window. You can edit the deplyment descriptor's XML by right-clicking its node 
  and choosing Edit.</p>
<p>The IDE also automatically registers the DTDs and schemas for all the J2EE 
  deployment descriptors, as well as the Sun Java System Application Server DTDs. 
  You can therefore check and validate the XML in your deployment descriptors 
  according to the DTDs and schemas. You can view the DTDs by going to the Runtime 
  window and expanding the XML Catalogs node.</p>
