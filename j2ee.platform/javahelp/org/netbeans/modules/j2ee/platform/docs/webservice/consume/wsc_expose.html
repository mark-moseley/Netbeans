<h2>Exposing the Web Service Client in the Projects Window</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>When you use the Web Service Client wizard, the IDE creates files such
 as stubs and other artifacts. These files are regenerated whenever you run the Build Project command.
 Therefore, like all oher files that are regenerated during builds, these files are not shown in the Projects window. If you want to see
 the client files generated by the IDE, you must open the Files window (Ctrl-2) and
 look in the <tt>build</tt> folder until you find the client package that you
  defined in the Web Service Client wizard. Sometimes you may need to examine these files
  on a regular basis and expanding nodes in the Files window can be tedious. Therefore,
  you can manually add the package that you created in the Web Service Client wizard to the Projects window.
 This gives them greater visibility and lets you work with them more easily.

 <p><b>To expose the web service client artifacts in the Projects Window:</b>
	
<ol>
	<li><a href="wsc_create.html">Create the web service client</a>
	<li>Right-click the project node and choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
	<li>In the upper part of the Sources panel, click Add Folder and browse to the package containing the client files.
	<p>The client package is now displayed in the Source Package Folders list.
	<li>Click OK.
</ol>

<p>Now that you have added the client package as a source package folder, the
 following IDE functionality is available:
 <ul>
	 <li>Code completion in a Java source file or JSP file find the classes
	  in the client package.
	 <li>Go to class (Ctrl-Shift-O) in a Java source file or JSP file finds
	  the classes in the client package.
  </ul>

<td>Do not add Java classes, or any other file, to the package that you added
	to the Projects window.	Do not modify any of the files that you find
	in this package. The reason for this is that when you run the Clean Project command, the package and
	its contents will be cleaned and you will lose the new and changed
	files you added to the package.</td>
