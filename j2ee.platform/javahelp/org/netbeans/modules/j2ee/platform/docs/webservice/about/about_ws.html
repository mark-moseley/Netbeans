<h2>About Web Services</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>Web services are distributed application components that conform to standards 
  that make them externally available. They solve the problem of integrating diverse 
  computer applications that have been developed independently and run on a variety 
  of software and hardware platforms. The proliferation of distributed environments 
  has created a need for an enterprise to be able to expose all or part of the 
  functionality of an application to other applications over an open network.</p>
<p>Web services come in two styles, document-style and RPC-style:	
<ul><li><b>Document-style.</b> The client interacts with the web service using 
  documents that are meant to be processed as complete entities. These documents 
  typically take the form of XML, which is defined by a commonly agreed upon schema 
  between the service provider and its client. It is also possible that the document 
  exchanged in such an interaction could be in a format other than XML (such as 
  encrypted files); however, the value of agreeing on a XML schema is to facilitate 
  interoperability. In other words, the document represents a complete unit of 
  information and may be completely self-describing.
  <p>If the following statements are true for your application, you should
probably create a document-style web service:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client interacts asynchronously with the web service, so that immediate responses
are not expected.</li>
<li>The web service is data-oriented, not process-oriented.
</ul></li>
  <li><b>RPC-style.</b> The web service is viewed by the client as a single logical 
    application or component with encapsulated data, where the WSDL described 
    by the publicly-published interface and the XML in the SOAP messages exchanged 
    is formatted to map to the discrete operations published by that application. 
    In fact, the messages directly map onto input and output parameters of the 
    procedure calls or operations. Typically, such invocations occur over a synchronous 
    transport protocol like HTTP, where the SOAP request and response is piggybacked 
    on the protocol-level request-and-response, respectively, to form synchronous 
    request-response interaction patterns.</p> 
    <p>For example, a RPC-style web service can implement a payment service that accepts 
  payments and returns a status, or a stock quote service that accepts a ticker 
  symbol and returns the current quote in the HTTP response.</p>
  <p>If the following statements are true for your application, you should
probably create a RPC-style web service:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The web service client requires an immediate response, in a synchronous  fashion.</li>
<li>The web service is process-oriented, not data-oriented.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<h3>Web Services in the IDE</h3>
<p>In the IDE, you can create a web service by <a href="../create/create_ws_from_wsdl.html">implementing an existing WSDL file</a>,
<a href="../create/create_ws_from_code.html">exposing existing code</a>, or <a href="../create/create_ws_from_scratch.html">creating from scratch</a>.
The IDE generates deployment information in the deployment descriptors, the Java code that describes
the web service (the implementation class and the Service End Point Interface), and a compilation target in
the Ant build script. After you finish development,
you can finetune your web service using settings for building a <a href="../build/compile_wsdl.html">web service from a WSDL file</a>,
a <a href="../build/compile_doc.html">document-style web service</a>, or a <a href="../build/compile_rpc.html">RPC-style web service</a>.
  Then, when you
  build the web service, the <a href="../build/about_wscompile.html"><tt>wscompile</tt> tool</a> 
  is called to generate the web service artifacts required for deployment.</p>
