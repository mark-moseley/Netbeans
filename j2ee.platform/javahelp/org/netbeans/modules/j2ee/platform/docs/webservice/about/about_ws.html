    <h2>About Web Services</h2>
    <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
    <p>Web services are distributed application components that conform to standards 
    that make them externally available. They solve the problem of integrating diverse 
    computer applications that have been developed independently and run on a variety 
    of software and hardware platforms. The proliferation of distributed environments 
    has created a need for an enterprise to be able to expose all or part of the 
    functionality of an application to other applications over an open network.</p>
    <P>The promise of web services architecture is to allow you to
    connect applications that were developed on different platforms and
    in different programming languages. This can only work if vendors can
    agree on common standards. 

    <p>There are two distinct web service programming models, both of which
    are supported by the IDE, the first is specific to the Java EE 5 specification,
    while the second is specific to the J2EE 1.4 specification:
    <ul><li><b>Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS).</b> This programming model
        relates specifically to Java EE 5. A follow-on release of Java API for XML-based RPC 1.1 (JAX-RPC), JAX-WS 
        simplifies the task of developing web services using Java technology. It addresses some of 
        the issues in JAX-RPC 1.1 by providing, for example, annotations to simplify web service 
        development and reduce the size of runtime JAR files. 

        <li><b>Java API for XML-based RPC (JAX-RPC).</b> JAX-RPC is the 
        programming model for creating web services and
        clients in Java (not necessarily J2EE 1.4). The JSR 109 implementation facilitates the
        creation of JAX-RPC web services and clients in the J2EE 1.4 environment. 
    </ul> 

    <p>Both programming models are based on
    the following three specifications:</P>
    <UL>
        <LI><P><B>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).</B> Defines the
            mechanism by which a web service is called and how data is returned.
            For detailed information, refer to the SOAP 1.1 Specification. 
        </P>
        <LI><P><B>WSDL (Web Service Definition Language).</B> Describes the
            external interface of a web service. For detailed information, refer
            to the WSDL 1.1 Specification. 
        </P>
        <LI><P><B>UDDI (Universal Discovery, Description, and Integration)</B>
        Registries contain information about web services, including the
        location of WSDL files and the location of the running services. The
        IDE does not let you publish web services to or
        browse from a UDDI registry, although the WSDL files that you
        use can come from a variety of sources, including a UDDI registry.</P>
    </UL>
