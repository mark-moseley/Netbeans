<h2>About Business Methods</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A business method is a method inside an enterprise bean that performs some 
  function and can be called from outside the bean. Business methods are 
  written in the bean class and exposed through local or remote interfaces.
  If a business method is meant to be called by beans and clients that are running
  in the same JVM (on the same server), they are registered in the bean's local
  interface. If the method is meant to be called from a remote client, it is 
  registered in the bean's remote interface.</p>
<p>A session bean's business methods typically define tasks that the bean performs 
  for clients. They are not necessarily associated with data in a database.</p>
<p>In EJB 2.1 programming, an entity bean represents a persistent business object whose data is stored 
  in a database. The bean adds behavior specific to that data. Therefore, an entity 
  bean's business methods are typically accessor and mutator methods that enable 
  you to read and update information in a database that represents a business 
  concept. Entity bean business methods are almost always local methods, since 
  remote clients should only access an entity bean through a facade session bean.</p>
<h3>Business Methods in the IDE</h3>
<p>In the IDE, you can generate business methods by opening the bean class in the Source
  Editor, right-clicking anywhere in the body of the class, and choosing 
  Insert Code &gt; Add Business Method. You can also just code a regular method and then
  click the IDE hint in the left margin and choose an interface from the popup menu.</p> 
  <p>When you create an EJB 2.1 enterprise bean (J2EE 1.4), the IDE creates 
  a special <tt><i>BeanInterface</i>Business</tt> interface in which it registers 
  business methods. The bean interface extends the <tt>Business</tt> interface
  and the bean class implements both the bean interface and the <tt>RemoteBusiness</tt> 
  interface. </p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that it lets you separate the business logic 
  from implementation logic, and that it lets you check at compile-time that your 
  bean implements the given interfaces. If you want to register business methods 
  directly in the bean's interfaces, delete the <tt>Business</tt> interface files. 
  Then edit the bean interface to not extend the <tt>Business</tt> interface and edit 
  the bean class to not implement the <tt>Business</tt> interface.</p>
<p>When working with EJB 3.0 enterprise beans (Java EE 5), there is no need for a
separate Business interface. EJB 3.0 enterprise beans are regular Java objects and 
therefore have only the remote and local interfaces.</p>
