<h2>About Business Methods</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>A business method is a method inside an enterprise bean that performs some 
  function and is available for any clients of the bean. Business methods are 
  typically written in the bean class and registered in the bean's remote interface.</p>
<p>An entity bean represents a persistent business object whose data is stored 
  in a database. The bean adds behavior specific to that data. Therefore, an entity 
  bean's business methods are typically accessor and mutator methods that enable 
  you to read and update information in a database that represents a business 
  concept.</p>
<p>A session bean's business methods typically define tasks that the bean performs 
  for clients. They are not necessarily associated with data in a database.</p>
<h3>Business Methods in the IDE</h3>
<p>In the IDE, you can generate business methods by right-clicking the bean node 
  in the Projects window and choosing Add <img src="../../images/arrow.gif" width="5" height="11" alt="and add">&nbsp;Add 
  Business Method. When you create an enterprise bean in the IDE, the IDE creates 
  a special <tt><i>BeanName</i>RemoteBusiness</tt> interface in which it registers 
  business methods. The <tt><i>BeanName</i>Remote</tt> interface extends the <tt><i>BeanName</i>RemoteBusiness</tt> 
  and the bean class implements both the <tt><i>BeanName</i>Remote</tt> interface 
  and the <tt><i>BeanName</i>RemoteBusiness</tt> interface. </p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that it lets you separate the business logic 
  from implementation logic, and that it lets you check at compile-time that your 
  bean implements the given interfaces. If you want to register business methods 
  directly in your remote interface, delete the <tt><i>BeanName</i>RemoteBusiness.java</tt>, 
  delete <tt><i>BeanName</i>RemoteBusiness</tt> from the list of interfaces <tt><i>BeanName</i>Remote</tt> 
  extends and from the list of interfaces the bean class implements.</p>
