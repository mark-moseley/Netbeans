<h2>About Enterprise Applications</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>An enterprise application is a collection of EJB modules and web modules that 
  are configured to work together when deployed to a J2EE application server. The 
  enterprise application contains information about how the the modules work with 
  each other.</p>
<p>The enterprise application also contains information about how the modules 
  work with the application server to which the enterprise application is deployed. 
  For example, if any entity beans use container-managed persistence, the enterprise 
  application tells the J2EE application server what transaction services are 
  needed. </p>
<p>An enterprise application has no source files of its own. It only contains 
  deployment descriptors and other configuration files. At compile time, the JAR 
  files for each of the enterprise application's modules are built and assembled 
  into one Enterprise Archive (EAR) file. This file is deployed to the J2EE application 
  server.</p>
