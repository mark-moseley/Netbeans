        <h2>Web Service Attributes Editor: Global Customization</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> 
        <p>The WSDL Customization panel of the Web Service Attributes Editor 
        is available to JAX-WS (Java EE 5) web services and clients
        that are created from WSDL. In these scenarios, <tt>wsimport</tt> is invoked to
        generate the JAX-WS artifacts. By default, <tt>wsimport</tt> follows
        the binding rules specified by the JAX-WS specification. You use the WSDL Customization 
        panel to
        customize the behaviour of <tt>wsimport</tt> when generating these artifacts. 
        <p>You access the WSDL Customization panel of the Web Service Attributes Editor from the Projects window.
        Right-click the node representing a "from WSDL" artifact and then choose Edit Web Service
        Attributes. For example, for web service clients, expand the Web Service References
        node, right-click a node representing a web service client, and choose Edit
        Web Service Attributes. The editor appears. Choose the WSDL Customization tab and
        the panel opens.
        <h3>Global Customization</h3>
        <p>Use the Global Customization section of the WSDL Customization panel
        to customize the entire WSDL file.
        That is, if it is not overridden in the lower level elements, any customization 
        specified in the Global Customization section is followed throughout the affected 
        elements in the WSDL file. For example, if Enable Asynchronous Client is enabled 
        in the Global Customization section and no customization is done on any Port Types
        or Port Type Operations, 
        then all operations in the WSDL file will be generated as asynchronous. However, you can
        override the higher level customization. 
        <p>To continue our example, if there are two 
        Port Types, A and B, if you disable the asynchronous operation in Port Type B, then all
        operations in A will be asynchronous and operations in B will not be asynchronous. 
        You can then override at the operations level.  Therefore, the overriding mechanism follows
        the hierarchy: Global Customization&gt;PortTypes&gt;PortType.
        
        <p>You can define the following global properties:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Package Name.</b> Customizes the package name that you specified when
            creating the artifact.</li>
            <li><b>Enable Wrapper Style.</b> Customizes the  way the parameter types and return 
            types of a WSDL operation are generated. By default, <tt>wsimport</tt> uses
            the wrapper style. For example, if an operation has one input message, named
            <tt>setLastTradePrice</tt>, and one output message, named <tt>setLastTradePriceResponse</tt>, and
            the part in the <tt>setLastTradePrice</tt> is really made up of two primitive types, 
            a string and a float, <i>without</i> wrapper style, <tt>wsimport</tt> generates the following 
            Java code:
            <pre>SetLastTradePriceResponse setLastTradePrice(SetLastTradePrice setLastTradePrice);</pre>
            
            <p>However, <i>with</i> wrapper style, <tt>wsimport</tt> generates the following Java code:
            <pre>void setLastTradePrice(String tickerSymbol, float lastTradePrice);</pre>
            
            <p>As you can see, with the wrapper style, the method parameters are 
            broken down to its components.
            Thus, specifying wrapper or non-wrapper style is dependent on the
            coding style of the developer. 
            
            <li><b>Enable MIME Content.</b> Customizes the attachment mechanism that provides
            additional metadata as to how the WSDL type is bound to Java. In the binding section
            of the WSDL file, if the MIME part is qualified with <tt>mime:content</tt> information,
            you have the option of using this information to tell <tt>wsimport</tt> what types 
            to generate. If, for example, an operation sends binary data (e.g., <tt>xsd:base64Binary</tt>),
            and, in the binding section, the binding is qualified as a MIME multipart-related 
            with MIME-content information that says that the type can be a GIF file. 
            If Enable MIME Content is set to false, the data will be bound to a Byte array.
            If Enable MIME Content is set to true, <tt>wsimport</tt> will use the information
            in the <tt>mime:content</tt> portion of the binding section and bind it to 
            <tt>java.awt.Image</tt>.
            
            <li><b>Enable Asynchronous Client.</b> Generates asynchchronous methods for
                the WSDL operations. For each operation, two asynchronous methods are
            generated. For details, see <a href="../../consume/wsc_call_ws_asynchronous.html">Asynchronously Calling a Web Service Operation</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If the latter three properties are enabled in the Global Customization section,
                all port type operations will be affected. You can then override at the port type level to affect only the operations 
                of that port type. And, finally, you can overrride at the port type operation level to designate which operations
            are affected.</li>
        </ul>
