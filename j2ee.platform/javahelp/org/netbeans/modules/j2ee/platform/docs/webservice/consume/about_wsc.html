        <h2>About Web Service Clients</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>A web service client is created to consume (that is, use) a specific <a href="../about/about_ws.html">web service</a>.
        The way in which a web service client consumes a web service depends on the way in which the provider makes the web service available:
        <ul> <li>The provider publishes the <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html">WSDL file</a>
            of a running web service.</li>
            <li>The provider distributes a WSDL file, which is available to you on your local filesystem.
            <li>The provider distributes a NetBeans project that defines the web service, for
            deployment to a test container.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The strategy that you take in comsuming a web service depends first and foremost
        on the specification that you choose to adopt. Either use the Java EE 5 specification,
        which provides for JAX-WS web services, or follow the J2EE 1.4 specification, which
        assumes the use of the JAX-RPC web services:
        <ul>
            <li><b>JAX-WS web service clients (Java EE 5)</b>. For consuming JAX-WS web services, there is one type
            of web service client, the IDE-generated static stub. The IDE generates 
            the stub and other artifacts, packages them in the archive, and deploys them. Since
            JAX-WS does not need to work with deployment descriptors, but uses annotations within
            the Java code instead, a J2EE container-generated static stub, which
            implies the use of deployment descriptors, would be superfluous.
            
            <li><b>JAX-RPC web service clients (J2EE 1.4).</b> For consuming JAX-RPC web services, there are two types of web service clients:</p>
            <ul><li><b>J2EE Container-generated static stub.</b> 
            This type is based on JSR-109, which enhances JAX-RPC by defining the packaging
            of web services into standard J2EE modules, including a new deployment descriptor,
            and defining web services that are implemented as session beans or servlets.
            This is the recommended and portable (via J2EE 1.4 specification) type.
            When you choose this type, the IDE adds deployment information in the 
            deployment descriptors and the container generates the stub and other artifacts.</li>
            <li><b>IDE-generated static stub.</b> 
            This type is based on JSR-101, which defines the mapping of WSDL to Java and vice versa.
            It also defines a client API to invoke a remote web service and a runtime environment 
            on the server to host a web service. This type is not portable.
            When you choose this type, the IDE generates 
            the stub and other 
            artifacts, packages them in the archive, and deploys them.</li></ul>
