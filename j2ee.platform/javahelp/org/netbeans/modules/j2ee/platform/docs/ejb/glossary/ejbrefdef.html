<h6>EJB reference</h6>
<p>A reference in one enterprise bean to another enterprise bean that 
  has a home interface and a remote interface. This type of reference gives the 
  referencing enterprise bean remote access to the referenced bean's methods, 
  but imposes all the overhead of remote references, including pass-by-value, 
  marshalling, and stubs.</p>
<p>Each EJB reference has a corresponding <tt>ejb-ref</tt> entry in the deployment 
  descriptor.</p>
