<h2>About Servers</h2>
<p><small> <a href="#seealso">See Also</a> </small></p>
<p>A server is a computer that serves up applications. Any computer can be turned 
  into a server if you install server software and connect the computer to the 
  Internet. A number of servers are supported by the IDE.</p>
<h3>Java EE Application Servers</h3>
<p>A Java EE application server, also known as a Java EE container, is any server that 
  is fully compliant with the J2EE 1.4 platform. Unlike a regular web server, 
  an application server can run full enterprise applications, enterprise bean 
  modules, and web services. It can also use Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) 
  entity beans to handle communication with a database.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>You can also configure the Tomcat web server to run web services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IDE supports the following application servers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Sun Java System Application Server/GlassFish. </b>The IDE provides the fullest 
    support for the Sun Java System Application Server. You can stop and start 
    the server, deploy applications to it, and view the deployed modules directly
    in the Services window. There is a visual editor for server-specific deployment 
    descriptors and the IDE updates the descriptors automatically as you write 
    your code. The IDE also automatically configures server resources like connection 
    pools and JavaMail resources for this application server.</li>
  <li><b>JBoss Application Server, BEA WebLogic Application Server</b> and <b>IBM WebSphere Application Server.</b> The
  IDE provides basic support for these application servers. You can start, stop,
  and debug the servers and deploy applications to them. </li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Tomcat Web Server</b> </h3>
<p>Use this server and its libraries for the following activities: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Deploying web applications, JSP pages, and servlets.</li>
  <li>Deploying web services and web service clients that use JSR-101 stubs. </li>
  <ul class="note">
    <li> The Tomcat Web Server is not a J2EE 1.4 container. Therefore, you cannot 
      deploy a web service client that uses JSR-109 stubs to this server. When 
      you <a href="../webservice/consume/wsc_create.html">create the web service 
      client</a>, make sure that you select IDE-generated static stub in the Client 
      Type drop-down. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Servers in the IDE</h3>
<p>Before you can deploy an enterprise application, web application, JSP, servlet, 
  or EJB module, the server to which you are going to deploy needs to be <a href="server_register.html">registered</a> 
  with the IDE. When a server is registered with the IDE, its libraries are available 
  for production, or deployment, or both. Servers that are installed during the IDE installation process
  are automatically registered in the IDE. You must register all other servers yourself.</p>
<ul class="note">
      <li>Only once you have registered a Java EE application server 
        can you begin developing <a href="../enterprise/general/about_ent_apps.html">enterprise 
        applications</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>When a server is registered with the IDE, you can see its node in the Services 
  window under the Servers node. When you create a project in the New Project 
  wizard, you can select the server to which you want to deploy your application. 
  After you create the application, you can change the server by right-clicking 
  the project, choosing Properties, clicking Run, and selecting a different server.</p>
