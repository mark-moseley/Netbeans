<h2>About Servers</h2>
<p><small> 
<a href="#seealso">See Also</a> 
</small></p>
<p>A server is a computer that serves up applications. 
Any computer can be turned into a server if you install server software
and connect the computer to the Internet. The following servers
are supported by the IDE:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SJS App Server</b>
<p>Use this server and its libraries for the following activities:
    <ul><li>Deploying <a href="../enterprise/general/about_ent_apps.html">enterprise applications</a> 
	    and <a href="../ejb/general/about_ejbs.html">enterprise beans</a>.</li>
	    <li>Deploying <a href="../webservice/about/about_ws.html">web services</a>
	    and <a href="../webservice/consume/about_wsc.html">web service clients</a> that use JSR-109 or JSR-101 stubs.</li>
	<li>Deploying <a href="../web/about/about_webapps.html">web applications</a>, 
	<a href="../web/create/jsp/about_jsp_technology.html">JSP pages</a>,
       	and <a href="../web/create/servlet/about_servlet.html">servlets</a>.</li>
	<li>Libraries included with the SJS App Server can be used 
            to <a href="../webservice/build/about_wscompile.html">compile</a> web services and clients,
            <a href="../enterprise/general/ent_app_verify.html">verify</a> that your application
            implements the J2EE 1.4 specification correctly, create a new web application with
            <a href="../web/create/tag/framework/framework_jsf_create.html">JavaServer Faces (JSF) support</a>,
            or <a href="../web/create/tag/framework/framework_jsf_add.html">add JSF support</a>
	    to an existing web application</li>
    </ul></li>
<li><b>Tomcat Web Server</b>
<p>Use this server and its libraries for the following activities:
<ul><li>Deploying web applications, JSP pages,
       	and servlets.</li>
	<li>Deploying web services and web service clients that use JSR-101 stubs.
	    <table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
            <tr valign="top"> 
            <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
            <td>The Tomcat Web Server is not a J2EE 1.4 container. Therefore, you cannot deploy a web service client
	        that uses JSR-109 stubs to this server. When you <a href="../consume/wsc_create.html">create the web service client</a>,
		make sure that you select JAXRPC Static Stub in the Web service client type drop-down.</td></tr></table></li></ul>
</ul>
<h3>Servers in the IDE</h3>
<p>Before you can deploy an enterprise application, web application, JSP, servlet, or EJB module, 
the server to which you are going to deploy needs to be registered with the IDE. 
By default, only the bundled Tomcat Web Server is registered with the IDE. 
You are not able to deploy to the SJS Application Server
or an external Tomcat web Server until you <a href="server_register.html">register</a> it with the IDE yourself.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
   <tr valign="top">
      <td><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
      <td>
	      Only once you have registered the SJS Application Server
	      can you begin developing enterprise applications.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>
<p>When you register a server with the IDE, you make its libraries available for production,
 or deployment, or both. If you deploy your applications to a remote instance of the
 SJS Application Server, its libraries are available at runtime. However, during 
 development, you might need a local instance of this server.
You can have multiple instances of the SJS Application Server registered with the 
IDE. Once you have registered your local instance, you can register remote instances, 
but you always have to specify the local folder that contains the local installation of 
the SJS Application Server.</p>
<p>When a server is registered with the IDE, you can see its node in the Runtime 
window under the the Server Registry node. When you create a project in the New Project wizard, 
you select the server to which you want to deploy your application. After you create the
 application, you can change the server by right-clicking the project,
 choosing Properties, clicking Run, and selecting a different server.</p>
