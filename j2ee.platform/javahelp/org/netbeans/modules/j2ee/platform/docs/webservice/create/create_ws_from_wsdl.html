        <h2>Generating a JAX-WS Web Service from a WSDL File</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>When you and your business partners agree on a "contract" in the form of a WSDL file,
        you can use the IDE to implement it. The WSDL file is an agreement on the data and  messages 
        that will be exchanged as well as how these messages will be sent and received. 
        In the IDE, you can use the WSDL file to implement the web service.</p>

        <p>Business requirements may demand that you create a platform-independent
        description of a web service as a set of XML schema files and WSDL files. Based on this
        platform-independent description, you can use the steps that follow to generate
        the implementation files. The WSDL file that you use in the steps below can either be
        available on disk or via a URL. You can even create the WSDL file yourself, using the IDE,
        as described in <a href="create_wsdl_file.html">Creating a WSDL File</a>.
 
        <ul class="note">
            <li>
                For J2EE 1.4 web services, if the WSDL file imports schemas, other WSDL files, or both, from the local file system, the web service will only work
                if the imported schemas and WSDL files are copied beforehand into the <tt>WEB-INF/wsdl</tt> (or <tt>META-INF/wsdl</tt>)
                folder. If you do not do this,
                the <tt>wscompile</tt> tool
                will not be able to locate these imported files at the end of the procedure below.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>To create a web service from a WSDL file:</b></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Depending on the <a href="about_implement_ws.html">implementation form</a>, create a web application project or an EJB module project.</li>
        <li>In the Projects window or Files window, right-click the project node
        and choose New &gt; File/Folder. In the Web Services folder, choose
        Web Service from WSDL.</li>
        <p>The New Web Service from WSDL wizard opens.</li>
        <li>Type the web service name and specify a package to house the web service.</li>
        <li>Browse to a WSDL file on your filesystem.</li>
        <li>Click Finish.
    
            <p>For JAX-WS web services (Java EE 5 specification), the IDE runs the <tt>wsimport</tt> tool, which results in the following:
            <ul>
	
            <li>A WSDL file file is consumed, created by the IDE. The abstract portion is copied as is from the original file, 
            while the concrete portion is "normalized" from the original. 
            For example, a SOAP binding element is created if it did
            not exist in the WSDL file. Also, the abstract service element is created to be compatible with
            the binding.</li>
            <li>An implementation class. The operations found
                in the WSDL file are added to this class.
            </li></ul>
        
            <p>For JAX-RPC web services (J2EE 1.4 specification), the IDE runs the <tt>wscompile</tt> tool, which results inS the following:
            <ul>
	
            <li>A new WSDL file. The abstract portion is copied as is from the original file, 
            while the concrete portion is "normalized" from the original. 
            For example, a SOAP binding element is created if it did
            not exist in the WSDL file. Also, the service element is created to be compatible with
            the binding.</li>
            <li>A Service Endpoint Interface (the "interface"), which declares the web service's operations. 
            In the IDE, the interface class is identified by the name of the 
            portType element defined in the WSDL.
            The IDE automatically populates the interface with a declaration for each web service operation
            from the WSDL file.</li>
            <li>An implementation class. The operations found
            in the WSDL file are added to this class. In the IDE, a JAX-WS class is
            identified by the name that you specify in the wizard. 
            In the IDE, a JAX-RPC implementation class is identified by the name of the 
            portType element defined in the WSDL together with the suffix "_Impl" (for web applications)
            or "_Bean" (for EJB modules).</li></ul>
            By default, the WSDL file is housed in the <tt>WEB-INF/wsdl</tt> (or <tt>META-INF/wsdl</tt>) folder. The 
            interface and the implementation class are housed in a package within your project's <tt>src</tt> folder (in the Files window)
            and you can access them in the Source Packages node (in the Projects window).
            </ul>
            <ul class="note">
                <li>You cannot add operations to a web service created from a WSDL file.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        </ul>
