        <h2>Generating a JAX-WS Web Service from a WSDL File</h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <p>When you and your business partners agree on a "contract" in the form of a WSDL file,
        you can use the IDE to implement it. The WSDL file is an agreement on the data and  messages 
        that will be exchanged as well as how these messages will be sent and received. 
        In the IDE, you can use the WSDL file to implement the web service.</p>

        <p>Business requirements may demand that you create a platform-independent
        description of a web service as a set of XML schema files and WSDL files. Based on this
        platform-independent description, you can use the steps that follow to generate
        the implementation files. The WSDL file that you use in the steps below can either be
        available on disk or via a URL. You can even create the WSDL file yourself, using the IDE,
        as described in <a href="create_wsdl_file.html">Creating a WSDL File</a>.
 
        <ul class="note">
            <li>
                For J2EE 1.4 web services, if the WSDL file imports schemas, other WSDL files, or both, from the local file system, the web service will only work
                if the imported schemas and WSDL files are copied beforehand into the <tt>WEB-INF/wsdl</tt> (or <tt>META-INF/wsdl</tt>)
                folder. If you do not do this,
                the <tt>wscompile</tt> tool
                will not be able to locate these imported files at the end of the procedure below.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>To create a web service from a WSDL file:</b></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Depending on the <a href="about_implement_ws.html">implementation form</a>, create a web application project or an EJB module project.</li>
        <li>In the Projects window or Files window, right-click the project node
        and choose New &gt; Other. In the Web Services folder, choose
        Web Service from WSDL.</li>
        <p>The New Web Service from WSDL wizard opens.</li>
        <li>Type the web service name and specify a package to house the web service.</li>
        <li>Browse to a WSDL file in your filesystem or type the URL to a WSDL file.</li>
        <li>Click Finish.
    
            <p>For JAX-WS web services (Java EE 5 specification), the IDE 
            runs the <tt>wsimport</tt> tool, which which reads the WSDL file
            and generates all the required artifacts for web service development, 
            deployment, and invocation. Finally, the IDE generates the skeleton
            implementation class, which corresponds to the WSDL port selected in the wizard.
