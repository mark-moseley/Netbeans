<h2>Creating a Web Service from a WSDL File</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>When you and your business partners agree on a "contract" in the form of a WSDL file,
you can use the IDE to implement it. The WSDL file is an agreement on the data and  messages 
 that will be exchanged as well as how these messages will be sent and received. 
 In the IDE, you can use the WSDL file to implement the web service.</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top"> 
<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>If the WSDL file imports schemas, other WSDL files, or both, from the local file system, the web service will only work
	if the imported schemas and WSDL files are copied beforehand into the <tt>WEB-INF/wsdl</tt> (or <tt>META-INF/wsdl</tt>)
       	folder. If you do not do this,
	the <a href="../build/about_wscompile.html">Web Service Compiler</a>
       	will not be able to locate these imported files at the end of the procedure below.</td>

 <p><b>To create a web service from a WSDL file:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Depending on the <a href="about_implement_ws.html">implementation form</a>, do one of the following:
<ul>
	<li><a href="../../web/create/about/create_webapps_proj.html">Create a web application project</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="../../ejb/editing/create_ejb_project.html">Create an EJB module project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top"> 
<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>Be sure to select the SJS Application Server as the target server for the project, otherwise you will not be able to build
	 the web service. 
	See <a href="../create/set_ws_server.html">Preparing the Develop Web Services and Clients</a> for more information.</td>

</table>
</li>
<li>In the Projects window or Files window, right-click the project node
and choose New <img src="../../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;Web Service.</li>
<p>The New Web Service wizard opens.</li>
<li>Type the web service name and specify a package to house the web service.</li>
<li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Browse to a WSDL file on your filesystem.</li>
<li>Specify a URL to an online WSDL file.</li></ul>

</li>
<li>Click Finish.
<p>The IDE runs the <tt>wscompile</tt> tool, which does the following:
<ul>
	
<li>Creates a new WSDL file. The abstract portion is copied as is from the original file, 
while the concrete portion is "normalized" from the original. 
See <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html">About the WSDL File</a> for abstract and concrete definitions in the WSDL file.
For example, a <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#binding">SOAP binding element</a> is created if it did
not exist in the WSDL file. Also, the <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#abstract">service element</a> is created to be compatible with
 the binding, and receives the web service name that you specified in the wizard, replacing the service element 
in the original WSDL file.</li>
<li>Creates the Service Endpoint Interface (the "interface"), which declares the web service's operations. 
In the IDE, the interface class is identified by the name of the 
<a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#abstract">portType element</a> defined in the WSDL.
The IDE automatically populates the interface with a declaration for each web service operation
 from the WSDL file.</li>
 <li>Creates the class for the implementation of the interface. The operations found
 in the WSDL file are added to this class.
In the IDE, an implementation class is identified by the name of the 
<a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#abstract">portType element</a> defined in the WSDL together with the suffix "_Impl" (for web applications)
or "_Bean" (for EJB modules).</li></ul>
By default, the WSDL file is housed in the <tt>WEB-INF/wsdl</tt> (or <tt>META-INF/wsdl</tt>) folder. The 
 interface and the implementation class are housed in a package within your project's <tt>src</tt> folder (in the Files window)
and you can access them in the Source Packages node (in the Projects window).
