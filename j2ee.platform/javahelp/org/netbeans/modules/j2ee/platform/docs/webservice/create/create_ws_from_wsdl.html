<h2>Implementing an Existing WSDL File</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
<p>When you and your business partners agree on a "contract" in the form of a WSDL file,
you can use the IDE to implement it. You can also use the IDE to reimplement web services
that have been published elsewhere, such as those offered by Amazon.com. 
 You do not need to know the details
 of the WSDL file when you create the web service, because the IDE provides
 wizards that guide you through the process.</p>
<p><b>To implement a WSDL file:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
	<li><a href="../../web/create/about/create_webapps_proj.html">Create a web application project</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="../../ejb/editing/create_ejb_project.html">Create an EJB module project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr valign="top"> 
<td><img src="../../images/tip.gif" alt="tip">&nbsp;</td>
<td>Later, you will not be able to <a href="../build/about_build_ws.html">build</a> the web service
	unless the SJS Application Server is the target
	 server for the project.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</li>
<li>In the Projects window or Files window, right-click the project node
and choose New <img src="../../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;Web Service.</li>
<p>The New Web Service wizard opens.</li>
<li>Type the web service name and specify a package to house the web service.</li>
<li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Browse to a WSDL file on your filesystem.</li>
<li>Specify a URL to an online WSDL file.</li></ul>
<li>Click Finish.
<p>The IDE does the following:
<ul>
<li>It "normalizes" the WSDL file. For example, a <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#binding">binding element</a> is created if it did
not exist in the WSDL file. Also, the <a href="../build/about_wsdl.html#binding">service element</a> is created to be compatible with
the name that you specified in the wizard.</li>
<li>It creates the Service Endpoint Interface (the "interface"), which declares the web service's operations. 
In the IDE, the interface is identified by the suffix "SEI". For example, if you named your 
web service <tt>CalculatorWS</tt>, its interface is named <tt>CalculatorWSSEI</tt>.
The IDE automatically populates the interface with a declaration for each web service operation
 from the WSDL file.</li>
 <li>It creates the class for the implementation of the interface. The operations found
 from the WSDL file are added to this class.
In the IDE, an implementation class is identified by the suffix "Impl" (for web applications)
 or "Bean" (for EJB modules). For example, if your 
 web service is named <tt>CalculatorWS</tt>, its implementation class is named <tt>CalculatorWSImpl</tt>
 or <tt>CalculatorWSBean</tt>.</li></ul>
By default, both files are housed in a package within your project's <tt>src</tt> folder (in the Files window)
and you can access it in the Source Packages node (in the Projects window).
</ul>
