	    This is a single WADL method for a single Amazon ECS operation.
	    No signature is required for ECS calls, so there could be a WADL
	    method per every operation.
	    
	    Perhaps WADL could be created by transforming the WSDL description 
	    (although it has XML messages for inputs/requests):
