GdbHelper 

The shared libraries in this directory are designed to overcome a
problem when debugging with console type set to output window. In
that specific instance, stdout is not buffered and stopping at a
breakpoint won't guarantee previously written output will be displayed.
To overcome this problem, these shared libraries have a single function
which sets line buffering on stdout.

If the shared library is installed in either <userdir>/bin or
<netbeans-install-dir>/cnd2/bin, the shared library will be auto-loaded
and the call to setup line buffering will be made. If sucessful, you
will be guaranteed that output to stdout will be flushed prior to
stopping at a breakpoint.

Prebuilt versions:
    Solaris 10, both x86 and sparc
    Linux Ubuntu 7.10 for x86
    Windows XP SP2 for x86
    MacOS 10.5 (Leopard) for x86

Building Your Own:
    The included Makefile is intended to manage the build on a wide
    variety of platforms. On Solaris, you'll need to use GNU make
    (shipped as gmake in /usr/sfw/bin and optionally in /opt/sfw/gmake).

    There is a potential problem that the shared library you build will
    not have the name the gdb module looks for. The module will put
    together the name string by concatenating "GdbHelper", the response
    from System.getProperty("os.arch"), the response from
    System.getProperty("os.name") with the expected extension on your
    platform. If Java returns "i386" or "i686" for "os.arch", the value
    is changed to "x86".

Known Problems:
    On Windows XP, the dll is sucessfully loaded and its function called.
    However, it still doesn't line buffer. This appears to be a problem
    in the Cygwin dll and will hopefully be fixed in a future update to
    Cygwin.
