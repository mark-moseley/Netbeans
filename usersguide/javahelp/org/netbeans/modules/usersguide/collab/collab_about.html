        <h2>About Collaborative Development</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Developers who are collaborating on a project require a
        set of tools and an infrastructure that can help them stay connected to each other
        and work together as a team. In addition to sharing sources,
        team members need to be able to share information and communicate with each other, 
        and how they share information depends on the type of information they need to share.</p>


        <p>In a collaborative environment, team members have different roles and requirements.
        For example, in addition to software developers, a team might also include people in the following roles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quality assurance</li>
            <li>Project management</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
            <li>User experience design</li>
            <li>Marketing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not all team members will use the same tools, but communication between members
        can be simplified when the infrastructure and tools are integrated.
        The IDE provides integrated support for the following collaborative tools
        and services:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kenai services.</strong>
            Kenai provides an infrastructure of services for each project hosted on Kenai.
            You can open and create Kenai projects and access many of the Kenai services in the IDE.

            <p>For more about the services available with Kenai projects, see
            <a href="about_kenai_projects.html">About Kenai Projects</a>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Issue tracking systems.</strong> (Bugzilla, JIRA)
            An issue tracking system enables developers and users to report and track
            issues associated with a project and provides a valuable feedback mechanism
            for people involved in the project.
            The integration of issue tracking systems in the IDE enables developers to find, view and
            resolve project issues from within the IDE.

            <p>For more about the issue tracker integration, see
            <a href="issues_about.html">About Issue Trackers</a>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Version Control Systems.</strong> (Subversion, Mercurial, CVS)
            The IDE provides integrated support for version control systems to help
            developers manage the history of file revisions.</li>

        </ul>
