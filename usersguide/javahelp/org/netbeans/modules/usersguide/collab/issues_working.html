        <h2>Working With Issues</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>After you register an issue tracking system with the IDE,
        you can perform most common issues-related tasks from within the IDE.
        If you are using an issue tracking system provided by Kenai, the issue tracker
        is already registered with the IDE and associated with a project.
        You can also <a href="issues_external.html">register an external tracker</a> in the Services window.
        </p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you are working on a project on Kenai,
            you can use the Kenai Dashboard to work with project issues.
            For more information, see <a href="kenai_dashboard.html">Working With Kenai Projects</a>.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Finding and Opening issues</h3>
            <p>The Find Issues form enables you to find and view reported issues on a registered issue tracker.
            You also use the Find Issues form to create and save queries.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>From the main menu, choose Team &gt; Find Issues.</li>
                <li>Select the issue tracker from the dropdown list.</li>
                <li>Specify the search criteria.</li>
                <li>Click Search.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Issues matching your search query are displayed at the bottom of the form.
            Double-click an issue to open it in a new window in the IDE.
            You can update the issue in the IDE.</p>
            
            <h3>Creating and Saving Issue Queries</h3>
            <p>The IDE enables you to save and name search queries that you use repeatedly.
            You can create and save queries using the Find Issues form or create a query as a URL.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the Find Issues form, select the issue tracker from the dropdown list.</li>
                <li>Specify the search criteria.</li>
                <li>Click Save this query.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After you save a query, the query is available at the top of the Find Issues form each time
                that you select the associated issue tracker.
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Reporting New Issues</h3>
            <p>If you are reporting an issue to an issue tracker provided by Kenai, you need to login to Kenai before
                you can submit the issue in the New Issue form.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>From the main menu, choose Team &gt; Report an Issue.</li>
                <li>Select the issue tracker for the project.</li>
                <li>Specify the details of the issue.</li>
                <li>Click Submit Issue.</li>
            </ol>
