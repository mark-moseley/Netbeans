<h2>About Managing Plugins</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The IDE's Plugins manager enables you to update and manage your IDE's plugins dynamically.
    You can minimize startup time and save memory by deactivating the plugins that you do not need. 
    Deactivated plugins are not deleted from your installation
    directory, but are simply ignored by the IDE. You can re-activate them at any time.</p>
    
    <p>You can also choose to uninstall plugins from the IDE. Uninstalled plugins are removed from
    your installation directory. To use an uninstalled plugins, you need to install it again.</p>
  
    <p>You use the Plugins manager to connect to the update centers to check if there 
    are new plugins or new versions of already installed plugins available. 
    If new or updated plugins are available, you can select, download, and install them using the Plugins manager.</p>

    <p>A plugin generally consists of a group of dependent modules.
    When you update a plugin, the update usually consists of updating one or more of the modules that make up the plugin.
    Deactivating a plugin usually consists of deactivating the individual modules that make up the plugin.</p>

    <ul class="note">
        <li>Some plugins may be dependent on modules in other plugins in order for the functionality to be implemented.
        The Plugins manager warns you when this is the case.</li>
    </ul>
