<h2>Options Window</h2>
<!--Pending
-What is the difference between having an unused setting and a place where no setting is defined?
-distinction between definition and value

the difference between revert and define?</pre>-->
<p><b>To open the Options window:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose Tools <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose"> Options.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the Options window to change any of the IDE's configurable settings. 
The left pane of the window contains a tree view of all of the configurable items in the IDE. 
The Origin of Setting (&lt;&lt;) column displays the <img src="images/project.gif" alt="Project Setting"> 
icon for settings that have a configuration specific to the current project. 
The right pane displays a property sheet, which contains the names and values of the 
settings for the item selected in the left pane. For some types of settings, 
there multiple tabs for distinct categories of properties (such as Sorting and Execution).</p>

<p>To edit a setting, click the setting's value in the property sheet. 
<ul>
<li>If the value is a string,  
you can edit the value inline and press Enter to save the change.</li>
<li>If a drop-down arrow appears when you click the value, you can select the arrow and choose the 
value from the combo box.</li>
<li>If an ellipsis (...) button appears, you can click the ellipsis button to open a property editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The IDE can store settings at three levels:</p>
<!--<p>You can configure settings at User and Project levels:</p>-->

<ul>
<li>Default - holds the default settings that come with the IDE installation. You can not change 
the default settings, but you can override the default settings at the user or project level.
If you modify a setting that is only defined in the default level, a definition with the modified values 
you provide is moved to the User level.</li>
<li>User - like default settings, settings defined at the User level apply to all of your projects. Settings 
defined at the User level override settings at the Default level. </li>
<li>Project - settings configured at the Project level only apply to the project in which they are configured. 
Any settings configured at the Project level override user settings and default settings. </li>
</ul>

<p>If the cell in the Origin of Setting (&lt;&lt;) column for the node you are configuring is empty, any changes 
that you make in the property sheet are applied at the User level. If the cell in the Origin of Setting (&lt;&lt;) 
column for the node you are configuring displays the <img src="images/project.gif" alt="Project Setting"> 
icon, any changes that you make in the property sheet are applied only to the current project. </p>

<p>You can see a table view of how the settings are stored by clicking the 
Origin of Setting (&lt;&lt;) cell. There are columns for project, user, and default settings. Each row 
represents a group of settings.

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th><b>Icon</b></th>
<th><b>Description</b></th>
</tr>

<tr><td><img src="images/setting-defined.gif" alt=" "></td>
<td>The settings for the corresponding node are defined at the level indicated in the column's title. Any changes made 
to those settings apply at that level.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/setting-inherited.gif" alt=" "></td><td>The settings for the corresponding node are 
inherited from a higher level.</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/setting-ignored.gif" alt=" "></td><td>The settings for the corresponding node are 
ignored.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>To configure a setting for the current project only:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Tools | Options.</li>
<li>In the top row of cells, click the Origin of Setting (&lt;&lt;) cell to display the 
levels for the settings.</li>
<li>Navigate to and select the node for the settings you want to configure.</li>
<li>Click the cell in the Projects column for the settings node you have selected and choose 
Define Here.
<p>The <img src="images/project.gif" alt="Project Setting"> icon appears in the Origin of 
Setting (&lt;&lt;) column.</p></li>
<li>In the property sheet, configure the desired settings.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>To revert from a project setting to a user setting:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Tools | Options.</li>
<li>In the top row of cells, click the Origin of Setting (&lt;&lt;) cell to display the 
levels for the settings.</li>
<li>Navigate to and select the node for the settings you want to configure.</li>
<li>Click the cell in the Default column for the settings node you have selected and choose 
Revert Definition.
<p>You are then prompted to make sure you want to remove that settings node's configuration for 
the current project. If you click Yes, the project reverts to using the setting stored at the User 
level.</p></li>
</ol>


<p><b>To revert to the default setting:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Tools | Options.</li>
<li>In the top row of cells, click the Origin of Setting (&lt;&lt;) cell to display the 
levels for the settings.</li>
<li>Navigate to and select the node for the settings you want to configure.</li>

the current project. If you click Yes, the project reverts to using the setting stored at the Default 
level.</p></li>
