        <p>You use this panel to specify the Diff Engine to use when comparing file revisions.
        If you use an external diff engine you can set diff command options in this panel.</p> 
        <p>You can access this panel by choosing Tools &gt; Options from the main menu, clicking the Miscellaneous category and then clicking the Diff tab.</p> 

        
	<p>You can select the following diff engine options:</p>
	<ul>
            <li><b>External Diff.</b> If selected, the IDE uses an external command-line diff executable.
            You can specify any diff command options (for example, <tt>diff -b</tt>) to be used when running the diff command from a command-line executable in the IDE.
            Diff options are not availabe when using the built-in diff engine.
            <ul class="note">
                <li>To use this option, you must have a command-line diff executable installed on your system if you want to compare revisions.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><b>Internal Diff Engine.</b> If selected, the IDE uses its internal diff engine.
            When using the internal diff engine, the only available option is to ignore white spaces.
            This option is selected by default.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <!--</li>
	    <li><b>Diff Visualizers.</b> Enables you to set properties for the Diff viewers, which display the results when comparing file revisions using the Diff command in the IDE.
	    Expand the Diff Visualizers node to set properties to configure the following: 
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Textual Diff Viewer.</b> You can enable or disable Context Mode and specify the number of lines of context to display. 
		If Context Mode is selected, the specified number of lines of context are displayed around differences in the textual diff.</li> 
		<li><b>Graphical Diff Viewer.</b> You can modify the default background highlight colors for changed text in the graphical diff viewer.
		Click the ellipsis button (...) to specify the color.</li>
	    </ul></li>
	    <li><b>Diff Services.</b> Enables you to enable or disable the service selector.
	    Expand the Diff Services node to set properties to configure the following:
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Built-in Diff Service.</b> You can enable or disable the diff service selector. 
		If Show Diff Service Selector is selected, the drop-down list to select a diff viewer is visible in the toolbar of the diff results window.
		The service selector enables you to switch between the diff viewers.  </li>
	    </ul></li>
	    <li><b>Merge Visualizers.</b> Enables you to set the display properties for the Graphical Merge Conflicts Resolver.
