<h1>Options: Object Types</h1>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The IDE categorizes all files by object type. 
Use this node to specify the properties of object types, which determine how the IDE handles objects of that type.</p>
<p>You can view all your existing object types and their properties by choosing Tools &gt; Options from the main menu and clicking Advanced Options in the Options window.
In the left pane, expand IDE Configuration &gt; System &gt; Object Types &gt; <i>object-type</i> node.</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Actions.</b> Specifies which pop-up menu items are available for objects of this object type. </li>
	<li><b>Extensions and MIME Types</b> (also called <b>Extensions</b> and <b>File Extensions</b>)<b>.</b> Specifies which file extensions the IDE recognizes as belonging to the selected object type. </li>
	<!--<li><b>Parse Class Files.</b> If true, a class file is parsed for its source property.</li>-->
	<li><b>MIME Type.</b> The MIME type used for Ant files in the IDE.</li>
	<li><b>Representation Class. (Read only)</b> Representation class of the loader.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="note">
	<li>When the IDE parses a file to identify its object type, it goes through the list of object types in the order in which it appears in the Options window until it finds a match. For example, since Ant scripts are also XML documents, the IDE treats them as XML documents unless the Ant Scripts object type appears before the XML Objects object type.</li>
</ul>
		<p>Typically, it is best to leave the object types in their default order. However, you might need to change the order to make the IDE correctly handle your files. You can change the order of object type nodes by right-clicking the Object Types node in the Options window and choosing Change Order.</p>
