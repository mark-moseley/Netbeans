        <h2>Importing Settings from a Previous Version of the IDE</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
        <p>When you launch a new version of the IDE for the first time, you are 
        prompted with the option of importing settings from a previous version of 
        the IDE. This prompt occurs only if you have a user directory on your 
        system from a previous version of the IDE and the user directory is in 
        the default location.</p>
        <p>The settings that are imported include the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard shortcuts</li>
            <li>Most Source Editor font and color settings</li>
            <li>Java Platform Manager contents</li>
            <li>Library Manager contents</li>
            <li>Database drivers</li>
            <li>Servers</li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Importing Editor Settings After the First Launch</h3>
        <p>If you do not import the settings at the first launch, you can manually import 
        selected settings later. In particular, you might want to import Source Editor 
        settings if you have carefully customized your previous installation.</p>
        <p>Source Editor settings that you have customized are stored in XML files 
in your user directory. </p>

<!--<p>The settings stored in XML files include code templates, macros, fonts and colors,
and keyboard shortcuts.  In addition, a general properties file exists for other 
properties not covered by the categories listed above.</p>-->

<!--<p>Source Editor settings are in the 
<tt>config/Editors/text/&lt;mime type&gt;</tt>.  Substitute 
<tt>&lt;mime type&gt;</tt> with the type of editor settings you want. 
For example, the Java editor settings are found in the <tt>x-java</tt>
directory. The name of the file reflects the type of settings it contains.</p>-->

<p>If you created named editor profiles in the Options window of the IDE, the default settings for that profile are located within the Editors folder. 
For example, if you created a profile called MyNetbeansProfile, the default settings for that profile are located in
<tt>config/Editors/MyNetbeansProfile</tt>, the Java editor specific settings for that profile are located
in <tt>config/Editors/text/x-java/MyNetbeansProfile</tt>, the HTML editor specific settings are located in
<tt>config/Editors/text/html/MyNetbeansProfile</tt> and so on.</p>

<p><b>To copy settings from a previous version of the IDE:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Within your system's file manager, navigate to the user directory of the old 
IDE installation.
<p>To find your user directory choose Help  &gt; About and click
the Detail tab in the About dialog box.  User Dir is listed last in the dialog box.</p></li>
<li>From the old IDE's user directory, navigate to <tt>config/Editors</tt>.</li>
<li>Copy the folders within the <tt>config/Editors</tt> folder.</li>
<li>Navigate to the user directory in your new installation and open the <tt>config/Editors</tt> folder.</li>
<li>In the <tt>config/Editors</tt> folder, create a new folder and give it a name such as <tt>NetBeans41</tt>.
<p>The name of the folder becomes the name of a profile in the IDE that you can switch to in order to 
adopt a group of settings.</li>
<li>Paste the copied folders inside of the new folder.
<p>The pasted files become part of the new profile.</li>
<!--<li>Find the settings file you are interested in.
<p>In particular, you probably would want to copy the settings in the <tt>Editor</tt> folder.</li>-->
<!--<li>Copy the desired settings file to the corresponding location in the user directory of 
the new version of the IDE.</li>-->
<li>Restart the new version of the IDE.</li>
<li>Choose Tools &gt; Options and click Fonts &amp; Colors.</li><!--TODO check ampersand-->
<li>In the Profile drop-down list, select the name .</li>
</ol>
<!--<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul class="note">
    <li>When copying properties between XML files, pay attention to the XML syntax for the properties, especially when copying properties from previous versions of the IDE.<li>
<li>There might not be an XML file for certain settings if you are using the default settings.
If you delete an XML settings file, the default settings are restored.</li>
</ul>-->
