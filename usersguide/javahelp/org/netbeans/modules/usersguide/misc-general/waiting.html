<h2>Waiting for Tasks to Finish Dialog Box</h2>
<p>This dialog box appears when the IDE cannot exit because a task is in process.</p>
<p>If there is a process
that has not yet completed, such as starting a server, click Cancel, wait
for the process to complete, then exit the IDE.</p>
 
<p>If you are running
an application from the IDE, click Cancel, close the application, and exit
the IDE. If there is a process that will not complete because of
a problem, click End Tasks.</p>
