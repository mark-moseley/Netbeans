<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>
The IDE provides many accessibility features that allow you read about and use the product in the manner most comfortable and convenient to you.
</p>
<H3>Keyboard Shortcuts</H3>
<P>
The IDE provide keyboard shortcuts for most actions. To see the available keyboard shortcuts, and edit them if you wish, choose Tools <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Keyboard Shortcuts. For information on changing or adding keyboard shortcuts, see <a href="../shortcuts/editorcuts.html">Editor Shortcuts</a> and 
<a href="../shortcuts/menucuts.html">Menu Shortcuts</a>.
</p>
For information on the keystrokes needed to navigate the help 
viewer, see <a href="jhshortcuts.html">JavaHelp Shortcuts</a>.
</p>
<H3>Mnemonics</H3>
<P>
The IDE provides mnemonics throughout the application.  A mnemonic
is an underlined letter that shows users which key to press
in conjunction with the Alt key to activate a command or navigate
to a component.
</p>
<H3>Web Browsers</H3>
<P>
The IDE is integrated with an external web browser, which by default is the Internet Explorer browser if you are running on the Windows platform and the Netscape Navigator browser if
you are running on the UNIX platform.  You can use this browser to view the online help.
For information, see <a href="alternate_browser.html">Displaying Help in an Alternate Browser</a>.

documentation, and the online help.  A style sheet includes a set of stylistic rules that describe how to present HTML pages, including the size, color, and font of the text.
