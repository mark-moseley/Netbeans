        <h2>Navigator Window </h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <!--Creator - change Window to View; get rid of Favorites reference; -->
        <p>The Navigator window provides a compact view of the currently selected file 
        and simplifies navigation between different parts of the file.</p>
        <p>For Java files, constructors, methods, and 
        fields are displayed. You can view these members either 
        as a simple list or as an inheritance tree. </p>
        <p>For some kinds of XML files, you can use the Navigator to view the 
        structure of the file. The Navigator window works with standard XML documents, XML 
        schema files, and Ant scripts.

        <p>You can open the Navigator window by choosing 
        Window&nbsp; &gt; Navigator (Ctrl-7). 
        By default, the Navigator window opens in the lower left corner of the IDE. To 
        display a source file in the Navigator window, select the file in the Source 
        Editor, the Projects window, the Files window, or the Favorites window.</p> 
        <h3>Java Files</h3>
        <p>When a Java file is selected, a drop-down list appears at the top of the 
        Navigator window to enable you to choose between
        the following two views:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Members view.</b> Alphabetical listing of the selected source file's members 
            (constructors, methods, and fields). </li>
            <li><b>Inheritance view.</b> Hierarchical tree view of the selected source file's
            members.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can display the Javadoc documentation for a member by 
        hovering the mouse over the member's node.</p>
        <p>In the Members view, you can right-click a node 
        and choose the following commands:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Go to Source.</b> Opens the class in the Source Editor and places the insertion point at the beginning of the 
            constructor, method, or field that the node represents.</li>
            <li><b>Create Javadoc.</b> Generates missing standard Javadoc tags for 
            the selected member.</li>
            <li><b>Sort by Name.</b> Displays the members in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li><b>Sort by Source.</b> Displays the members in the order in which they 
            appear in the code.</li>
            <li><b>Filters.</b> Opens a submenu that enables you to select some 
                common filters for the types of members to display. You can select any combination of the 
                following filters:
                <ul><li><b>Show Inherited Members.</b> Displays members 
                    that come from classes that the current class extends.</li>
                    <li><b>Show Fields.</b> Displays the class's fields.</li>
                    <li><b>Show Static Members.</b> Displays static fields and methods.</li>
                    <li><b>Show Non Public Members.</b> Displays members that do not 
                    provide public access.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can also activate and disable filters using the buttons at the bottom of 
        the Navigator window.</p>
        <p>In the Inheritance view, only the Go to Source command is available for the members.

        <h3>XML Files</h3>

        <p>For XML files, the Navigator view displays a tree of elements.</p>
        <p>You can right-click an element node and choose the following options for the level of
        detail to have displayed on the lines in the Navigator window:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Show Attributes.</b> Displays the attributes of each element.</li>
            <li><b>Show Content.</b> Displays the text content of each element.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ant Build Scripts</h3>

        <p>When an Ant build script is selected, a drop-down list appears at the top of the 
        Navigator window to enable you to choose between the following two views:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Ant Targets.</b> Alphabetical listing of build targets. </li>
        <li><b>XML View.</b> Hierarchical tree view XML elements in the build script.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When the Ant Targets view is selected, you can right-click a node and choose 
        one of the following commands:</p>
       
        <ul>
        <li><b>Open.</b> Opens the file in the Source Editor and places the insertion 
        point at the beginning of the selected target's line.</li>
        <li><b>Run Target.</b> Runs the selected target.</li>
        <li><b><a href="../../ant/ant_shortcut.html">Create Shortcut</a>.</b> Opens a wizard that enables you to create a menu 
        item, a toolbar item, a keyboard shortcut, and custom code for running the target.</li>
        <li><b>Properties.</b> Displays properties for the target in a property sheet. These properties are not editable.</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <p>When XML View is selected, you can right-click a node and choose 
        one of the following options for the level of
        detail to have displayed:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><b>Show Attributes.</b> Displays the attributes of each element.</li>
        <li><b>Show Content.</b> Displays the text content of each element.</li>
        </ul>
