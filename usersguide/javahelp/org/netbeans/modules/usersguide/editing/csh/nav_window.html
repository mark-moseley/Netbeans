        <h2>Navigator Window </h2>
        <p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small>
        <!--Creator - change Window to View; get rid of Favorites reference; change arrow.gif to &gt;-->
        <p>The Navigator window provides a compact view of constructors, methods, and 
        fields in the currently selected Java source file and simplifies navigation between 
        these members. You can view these members either as a simple list or as an inheritance tree. </p>

        <p>You can open the Navigator window by choosing 
        Window&nbsp;<img src="../../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Navigator (Ctrl-7). 
        By default, the Navigator window opens in the lower left corner of the IDE. To 
        display a source file in the Navigator window, select the file in the Source 
        Editor, the Projects window, the Files window, or the Favorites window.</p> 
       
 <p>The combo box at the top of the Navigator window enables you to choose between
        these two views:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Members view.</b> Alphabetical listing of the selected source file's members 
            (constructors, methods, and fields). </li>
            <li><b>Inheritance view.</b> Hierarchical tree view of the selected source file's
            members.</li>
        </ul>
<p>You can display the Javadoc documentation for a member by 
hovering the mouse over the member's node.</p>
        <p>In the Members view, you can right-click a node 
and choose the following commands from the contextual menu:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Go to Source.</b> Opens the class in the Source Editor and places the insertion point at the beginning of the 
            constructor, method, or field that the node represents.</li>
            <li><b>Create Javadoc.</b> Generates missing standard Javadoc tags for 
the selected member.<!--TODO check this--></li>
            <li><b>Sort by Name.</b> Displays the members in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li><b>Sort by Source.</b> Displays the members in the order in which they 
            appear in the code.</li>
            <li><b>Filters.</b> Opens a submenu that enables you to select some 
common filters for the types of members to display. You can select any combination of the 
following filters:
                <ul><li><b>Show Inherited Members.</b> Displays members 
                that come from classes that the current class extends.</li>
                    <li><b>Show Fields.</b> Displays the class's fields.</li>
                    <li><b>Show Static Members.</b> Displays static fields and methods.</li>
                    <li><b>Show Non Public Members.</b> Displays members that do not 
                    provide public access.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

<p>You can also activate and disable filters using the buttons at the bottom of 
the Navigator window.</p>
<p>In the Inheritance view, only the Go to Source command is available for the members.
