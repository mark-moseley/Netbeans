        <h2>Project Group: Create New Group Dialog Box</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Create New Group dialog box enables you to create 
            groupings of projects so that you can open and close 
            several projects at once. In addition, each group can have 
        a different main project.</p> 
        
        <p>You can open the Create New Group dialog box
        by choosing File &gt; Project Group &gt; New Group.</p>
        <p>You can create the following types of groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Free Group</b>. When you create a free group, 
                you can choose either of the following options:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Use Currently Open Projects</b>. 
                    Adds the currently open projects to the group.</li>
                    <li><b>Automatically Save Project List</b>. 
                        Changes the contents of the project group according 
                        to the projects that you open and close when the project 
                    group is open.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><b>Project and All Required Projects</b>. 
                Creates a group that consists of a master project and all 
            of the projects that it depends on.</li>
            <li><b>Folder of Projects</b>. Creates a group out of 
            all of the projects that are within a folder you specify.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have created a project group, that project group 
            is available in the Project Group menu. When you select a 
            project group from that menu, all other open projects are closed. 
            If you want to close all open projects, choose 
        File &gt; Project Group &gt; (none).</p>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you want to create a group that contains a specific 
                set of projects, make sure that those projects are the only open 
                projects. Then choose File &gt; Project Group &gt; Create New Group. 
                In the Create New Group dialog box, select the Free Group radio button 
            and select the Use Currently Open Projects checkbox. </li>
            <li>If you do not want the contents of a free group to change as 
            you open and close projects, clear the Automatically Save Project List.</li>
            <li>If you want to modify the contents of a free group that you set up 
            without the Automatically Save Project List option selected, open 
            any projects that you want to add and close any projects that you want 
            to remove from the group. Then choose 
            File &gt; Project Group &gt; Properties of <i>GroupName</i> and click 
            Save Current Project List Now.</li>
        </ul>
