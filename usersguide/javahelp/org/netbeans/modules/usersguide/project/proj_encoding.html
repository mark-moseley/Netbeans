        <p>By default, projects in the IDE are created using UTF-8 encoding. If you
            want to change encoding properties, the IDE provides you with the ability 
            to do so manually.</p>
            
        <p>If you want to change the encoding for a project, see: 
            <a href="../files/encoding.html">Setting Character Encoding</a></p>
            
        <h3>Opening Older Projects</h3>
        
        <p>If you open a project created in a previous version of the IDE</p>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>When you change the encoding for a project, the following occurs:
            
                <ul>
                    <li>All new files are created using the new project encoding.</li>
                    <li>All subsequent projects are created using the new encoding.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>The project encoding property value persists beyond the project that
                it applies to. This means that if you change the encoding for a 
                project, the new encoding value will become the default value for
                future created projects.</li>
            <li>If you change the project encoding property on a project that already 
                contains files that were created using a specific character encoding, 
                there is a risk that compiling and running the project may not succeed. 
                This is due to the fact that the programming compiler needs to be 
                passed an encoding value, and there can only be one such value.  
                Neither the IDE nor the programming language performs automatic encoding 
                detection of files.</li>
        </ul>    
        
        


  
        
        
when new project supporting the FEQ is created. The fall back encoding is an encoding 
used by the IDE when no one provides encoding for the file (project doesn't implement 
the FEQ), the fall back encoding is Charset.defaultCharset() which is the system encoding. 
The project which don't implement FEQ will work in the same way as in the NB 5.x.

New for NetBeans 6 is a project encoding property and a global project encoding 
value that is used for newly created projects.

This could apply to projects whose encoding property is not changed, but if files like 
jsp, xml and html files encoding tags are changed, since besides the encoding value 
used for runtime, the encoding tag affects how file is viewed internally during designtime, 
like in editor, debugger, etc.

A new project uses the ide's current view of what the project encoding should be  for 
setting the value of this new project's  project encoding property, which is the encoding 
used for reading and writing and creating all files and data in that project.

This ide view of the project encoding value, which is what is used for new projects that 
will be created during this session comes from the encoding of the last project created 
before this new one, or from the new encoding of an existing project where the user changed 
its project encoding - whichever of these actions were more recent (before a new project 
was created).

When one changes project encoding, all subsequently created new projects that have 
implemented feq use that changed encoding; projects that have not implemented it, or 
projects from previous nb in which there was not concept of feq, will use the encoding 
of the locale in which user was in when started n

the ide does not know how to do automatic encoding detection; for files like jsp/html/xml 
that have encoding or charset values, it uses those values as the file encoding but does 
not autodetect actual file encoding
