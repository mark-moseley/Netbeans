        <p>By default, projects in the IDE are created using UTF-8 encoding. If you
            want to change encoding properties, the IDE provides you with the ability 
            to do so manually.</p>
            
        <p>If you want to change the encoding for a project, see: 
            <a href="../files/encoding.html">Setting Character Encoding</a></p>
            
        <h3>Encoding detection in the IDE</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE implements the FileEncodingQuery (FEQ) layer model. FEQ is an 
            interface for obtaining information about which encoding can be used 
            for reading from/writing to a particular file. The layer model prioritizes
            encoding based on the following hierarchy:</p>
            
        <ol>
            <li><strong>File FEQ</strong>. The encoding value declared within a file.</li>
            <li><strong>Project FEQ</strong>. The value of the current global project encoding in a session.</li>
            <li><strong>Fallback FEQ</strong>. The encoding of the locale in which the IDE is running.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Opening Older Projects</h3>
        
        <p>Previous versions of the IDE (including 5.x) did not implement the FEQ. 
            Consequently, any project created from older versions will be opened
            using the fallback FEQ, i.e. the default locale set by your system's environment.</p>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>When you change the encoding for a project, the following occurs:
            
                <ul>
                    <li>All new files are created using the new project encoding.</li>
                    <li>All subsequent projects are created using the new encoding.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>The project encoding property value persists beyond the project that
                it applies to. This means that if you change the encoding for a 
                project, the new encoding value will become the default value for
                future created projects.</li>
            <li>If you change the project encoding property on a project that already 
                contains files that were created using a specific character encoding, 
                there is a risk that compiling and running the project may not succeed. 
                This is due to the fact that the programming compiler needs to be 
                passed an encoding value, and there can only be one such value.  
                Neither the IDE nor the programming language performs automatic encoding 
                detection of files.</li>
