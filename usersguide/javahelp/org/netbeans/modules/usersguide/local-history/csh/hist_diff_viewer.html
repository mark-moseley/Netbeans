        <h2>Local History: Diff Viewer</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The IDE's Diff Viewer enables you to select previously saved versions of a file 
            and compare them with the current file version. You can use the Diff Viewer to
            view two versions side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences
            between the versions being compared.</p>
            
        <p>You access the Diff Viewer by selecting a file (e.g. from the Projects or Files
            window) and choosing Show Local History.</p>
            
        <p>The upper pane of the Diff Viewer presents you with a table depicting all available 
            versions of the selected file:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version</strong>. Lists the version of the file, based on the date
                which the file was saved. Versions are listed chronologically, with the most 
                recent version at the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Label</strong>. Lists any label associated with the file.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can use labels as metadata for file versions. To add a label to
                a specific file version, click on the version row beneath the Label
                column and type in a label directly.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To view differences between two file versions.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Select a version from the table in the upper pane of the Diff Viewer. When 
                you select a version, the table row becomes highlighted in dark gray, and 
                the selected version displays on the left side in the Diff Viewer below. The 
                right side of the Diff Viewer displays the current file version.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can call commands directly on versions listed in the Diff Viewer's upper pane:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To revert your current file to a selected version:</strong> 
                        <br>From the table, right-click the version you want to revert changes 
                        to and choose Revert from History.</li>
                    <li><strong>To delete a version from the Local History repository:</strong>
                        <br>Right-click the version in the table and choose Delete from History.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
       
        <p>The following UI components facilitate navigation among and promote visibility of 
            differences between file versions.</p>        
        
        <ul>
            <li>The Previous (<img src="../images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button">) 
                and Next (<img src="../images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">) 
                Difference buttons in the toolbar allow you to navigate among individual differences 
                found between versions in the file.</li>
            <li>The Diff Viewer highlights changes in the files using the following colors:
        
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blue</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ).
                        Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier revision</li>
                    <li><strong>Green</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ).
                        Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier revision</li>
                    <li><strong>Red</strong> 
                        ( <span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> ).
                        Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier revision</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>The above color settings are set by default within the IDE. You can modify 
                these settings by choosing Tools &gt; Options from the main menu, then clicking
                Advanced Options. Expand IDE Configuration &gt; Server and External Tool Settings
                &gt; Diff and Merge Types &gt; Diff Visualizers &gt; Graphical Diff Viewer.
                From the right panel, you can select the colors of your choice.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The following icons enable you to make changes directly within the Diff Viewer:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Replace</strong> (<img src="../images/insert.png" alt="replace icon">).
                Inserts the highlighted text from the previous revision into the current revision</li>
            <li><strong>Move All</strong> (<img src="../images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon">).
                Reverts the file's current version to the state of the selected previous version.
            <li><strong>Remove</strong> (<img src="../images/remove.png" alt="remove icon">).
                Removes the highlighted text from the current version so that it mirrors the 
                previous version.
        </ul>
