        <p>The IDE's local history repository maintains previous versions of your project 
            sources,including files or folders which you have recently deleted.You can take 
            advantage of the IDE's local history tools to recover previously deleted files 
            and reinstate them into your project.</p>
        
        <p>If you have previously deleted files and they are still maintained in the IDE's 
            local history repository, you can invoke the Revert Deleted command to retrieve 
            them.</p>
            
        <h4>To recover previously deleted files:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>From the Projects or Files window, right-click the project or directory 
                that previously contained the files which you deleted and choose Local 
                History &gt; Revert Deleted. The previously deleted files reappear beneath
                the project or folder you selected.</li>

        <ul class="note">
