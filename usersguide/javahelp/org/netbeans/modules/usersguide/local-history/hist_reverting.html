        <h2>Reverting a File to a Previous Version</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The IDE's local history functionality enables you to revert your current file 
            to a previous version.</p>
        
        <p>There are two ways to revert a file's current version to any previously stored 
            version:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#revertTo">Using the Revert To dialog</a></li>
            <li><a href="#diffViewer">Using the graphical Diff Viewer</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <a name="revertTo"></a>
        <p>If you already know the version you want to revert to, you can use the 
            <a href="csh/hist_revert_dialog.html">Revert To</a> dialog box.</p>
        
        <h4>To revert a file using the Revert To dialog:</h4>
                
        <ol>
            <li>From the Projects or Files window, right-click the file you want to 
                revert changes to and choose Local History &gt; Revert to. The 
                <a href="csh/hist_revert_dialog.html">Revert To</a> dialog box opens, 
                enabling you to select a version from the provided table.</li>
            <li>From the table, select a row corresponding to the version you want to 
                revert changes to, then click Revert. The current state of the selected 
                file is reverted to the state of the selected version.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <a name="diffViewer"></a>
        <p>If you want to examine a previous version and revert only specific changes 
            in your current file to areas within that version, you can perform a
            side-by-side comparison between the two versions in the 
            <a href="csh/hist_diff_viewer.html">Diff Viewer</a>, and revert changes 
            in your current file based on the comparison.</p>
        
        <h4>To revert changes in a file using the Diff Viewer:</h4>        
                
        <ol>
            <li>From the Projects or Files window, right-click the file you want to 
                revert changes to and choose Local History &gt; Show Local History.
                The graphical Diff Viewer opens.</li>
            <li>Select a version from the table displayed in the upper area of the viewer.
                The selected version displays on the left side in the Diff Viewer below 
                and is compared against your current version.</li>
            <li>After examining differences between the two versions, use the icons 
                displayed in the Diff Viewer to make changes:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Replace</strong> (<img src="images/insert.png" alt="replace icon">). 
                        Inserts the highlighted text from the previous revision into the current 
                        revision</li>
                    <li><strong>Move All</strong> (<img src="images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon">). 
                        Reverts the file's current version to the state of the selected previous 
                        version.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove</strong> (<img src="images/remove.png" alt="remove icon">). 
                        Removes the highlighted text from the current version so that it mirrors the 
                        previous version.</li>
                </ul>       
            
                Any changes made using the Diff Viewer's icons are immediately applied to the 
                file's current version.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can make changes to your current version directly in the graphical Diff Viewer. 
                To do so, place the cursor directly in the Current Version pane and edit where 
                appropriate. The current version is instantaneously updated to reflect changes.</li>
        </ul>
