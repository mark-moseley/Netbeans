<h2>About Editing XML Documents</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML whose goal is to
  enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the
  way that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for ease of implementation
  and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML.</p>
<p>A data object is an XML document if it is well-formed, as defined
  in this specification. A well-formed XML document MAY in addition be valid
if it meets certain further constraints.</p>
The XML node (<img src="images/xmlObject.gif" alt="XML object node icon">) 
  represents an XML document in the IDE. You can create an XML document by choosing 
  File <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;New from the main window, 
  expanding the XML folder, and selecting XML Document.

<h3>Types of XML Documents in the IDE </h3>  
<p> The IDE has poopy pants, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>CSS.</b> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide a simple mechanism for formatting
      and adding style to HTML and XML documents. The IDE displays all CSSs as
      CSS nodes (<img src="./images/css.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="css node">)
      in the Files window. </p>
    You can create an CSS by choosing File <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;New
    from the main window, expanding the XML folder, and selecting Cascading Style
  Sheet. </li>
  <li><b>DTD.&nbsp;</b>A document type definition (DTD) describes the grammar
    that can be used in an XML file and indicates the valid arrangement of the
    file's tags. It can exist as a prologue to an XML file (internal DTD) or
  as a separate file (external DTD). 
  <p>A DTD node (<img src="./images/dtdObject.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="DTD object node icon">) 
  represents a document type definition (DTD) file. A DTD describes the tags that 
  can be used in an XML file and indicates the valid arrangement of those tags. 
  It can exist as a prologue to an XML file (internal DTD) or as a separate file 
  (external DTD). </p>
<p>You can create a new DTD by choosing File <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;New 
  from the main window, expanding the XML folder, and selecting DTD Entity. You 
  can also generate a DTD for any XML file by right-clicking the XML file and 
  choosing Generate DTD.</p>
</li>
  <li><b>XSL.</b> XSL stylesheets (<img src="./images/xslObject.gif" alt="XSL stylesheet node icon">)
      define transformation rules for your XML documents. You can perform an
      XML transformation to transform the data in an XML document into the output
      of your choice, such as formatted HTML or a text file. </p>
    You can create an XSL stylesheet by choosing File <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;New
  from the main window, expanding the XML folder, and selecting XSL Stylesheet. </li>
  <li><strong>SAX</strong>. The Simple API for XML (SAX) is a serial access protocol for XML. SAX
      is an event-driven API that you can use in your Java programs by registering
      a document handler with a SAX parser. After registration, the parser invokes
      your callback methods whenever it encounters a new XML tag, error, or other
      special condition.</p>
    You typically use the SAX protocol with servlets and network-oriented programs.
    SAX is the fastest and least memory-intensive mechanism currently available
    for dealing with XML documents. If you are writing an application that displays
  and possibly modifies an XML document, you might prefer to use the DOM mechanism. </li>
  <li><b>XML Catalogs.</b> XML catalogs provide mapping information
    that maps an external entity in an XML document to the actual location of
    the document being referenced. You can use a catalog to redirect mappings
  for an external entity, such as a DTD or XML file, to a different location. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Types of XML Documents in the IDE </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>XML Schema.</b> XML schemas (<img src="./images/xmlSchemaObject.gif" alt="XML shcema node icon" width="16" height="16">)
      specify the valid grammar of an XML document. Schemas have several advantages
      over DTDs, such as better extensibility, support of namespaces and data
      types, and an XML code base.</p>
    <p> You can create an XML schema by choosing File <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;New
      from the main window, expanding the XML folder, and selecting XML Schema.</p>
  <li><b>Parsed Entity.</b> Parsed entity nodes  (<img src="images/entObject.gif" alt="parsed entity node icon" width="16" height="16">)
     represent parsed entity (<tt>.ent</tt>) files. If several of your XML
     documents  refer to a single piece of information, you can store that information
     in a  parsed entity. Any changes you make to the parsed entity are then
     automatically  reflected in all of the documents that reference it.</p>
     <p>You can create an external parsed entity by choosing File <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose" >&nbsp;New 
  from the main window, expanding the XML folder, and selecting XML Parsed Entity. 
</p>
<p>You can edit a parsed entity by double-clicking its node in the Files window.
