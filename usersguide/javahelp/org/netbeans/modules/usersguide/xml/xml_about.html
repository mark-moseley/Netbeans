<h2>About Editing XML Documents</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML designed to
  enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web easily
  and efficiently. Because its format is not fixed, XML enables you to design
  your own customized markup languages with which to create various types of
  documents. </p>
<p>In the IDE,  XML documents  are represented by  XML nodes (<img src="images/xmlObject.gif" alt="XML object node icon">).
  The IDE provides tools to assist you in creating, editing, checking, and validating
  the various XML document types it supports. </p>
<!--<p>A data object is an XML document if it is well-formed, as defined in this
  specification. A well-formed XML document MAY in addition be valid if it meets
  certain further constraints.</p>--> 
<h3>XML Document Types in the IDE </h3>  
<p> The IDE supports several types of XML documents, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Cascading Style Sheet.</b> A CSS   (<img src="./images/css.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="css node">)
    provides a simple mechanism for formatting and adding style to HTML and XML
  documents. </li>
  <li><b>Document Type Definition.&nbsp;</b>A DTD (<img src="./images/dtdObject.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="DTD object node icon">)
    describes the grammar that can be used in an XML file and indicates the valid
    arrangement of the file's tags. It can exist as a prologue to an XML file
    (internal DTD) or as a separate file (external DTD). 
  <li><b>Parsed Entity.</b> Parsed entity nodes  (<img src="images/entObject.gif" alt="parsed entity node icon" width="16" height="16">)
     represent parsed entity (<tt>.ent</tt>) files. If several of your XML
     documents  refer to a single piece of information, you can store that information
     in a  parsed entity. Any changes you make to the parsed entity are then
     automatically  reflected in all of the documents that reference it.
    <p>For more information about using parsed entities in XML documents, see: </p>
<p><object CLASSID="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#TextEntities">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#TextEntities</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object></p>

  <li><b>XML Catalogs.</b> XML catalogs (<img src="./images/catalog-entry.gif" alt="XML shcema node icon" width="16" height="16">) provide mapping information
    that maps an external entity in an XML document to the actual location of
    the document being referenced. You can use a catalog to redirect mappings
  for an external entity, such as a DTD or XML file, to a different location. </li>

   <li><b>XML Schema.</b> XML schemas (<img src="./images/xmlSchemaObject.gif" alt="XML shcema node icon" width="16" height="16">)
      specify the valid grammar of an XML document. Schemas have several advantages
      over DTDs, such as better extensibility, support of namespaces and data
      types, and an XML code base.

  <li><b>XSL Stylesheet.</b> XSL stylesheets (<img src="./images/xslObject.gif" alt="XSL stylesheet node icon">)
      define transformation rules for your XML documents. You can perform an
      XML transformation to transform the data in an XML document into the output
      of your choice, such as formatted HTML or a text file. </li> 
</ul>
<h3>XML Protocols in the IDE </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>SAX</b>. The  Simple API for XML (SAX) is
    a serial access protocol for XML. SAX is an event-driven API that you can
    use in your Java programs by registering a document handler with a SAX parser.
    After registration, the parser invokes your callback methods whenever it
    encounters a new XML tag, error, or other special condition.  </li>
  <p>Typically,  the SAX protocol is used with servlets and network-oriented
    programs. SAX is the fastest and least memory-intensive mechanism currently
    available for dealing with XML documents. 
  <li> <b>DOM</b>. The Document Object Model (DOM) protocol converts an XML document 
    into a collection of objects in your program. You can then manipulate the 
    object model in any way that makes sense. This mechanism is also known as 
    the random access protocol because it permits you to access any part of the 
    data at any time. Typically, this protocol is used in applications that display 
    and modify XML documents.
