<h6>XML catalog</h6>
<p> XML catalogs provide mapping information that maps an external entity in an 
  XML document to the actual location of the document being referenced. You can 
  use a catalog to redirect mappings for an external entity, such as a DTD or 
  XML file, to a different location. 
<p>For example, if your XML document is constrained by a DTD that is located on 
  the Internet, and you are working without an Internet connection, you can redirect 
  the reference to a local copy of the DTD. You can then validate your XML document 
  without an Internet connection. Alternatively, you can use XML catalogs to switch 
  between different versions of the DTD.</p>
