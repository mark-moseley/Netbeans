<h2>Properties Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Most objects and object elements that are represented by nodes in the Projects window have properties that can be 
viewed in a property sheet. The Properties window displays the property sheet for the currently selected 
node in the Projects window.</p>

<p>To open the Properties window, choose Window <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Properties.</p>

<p>When the Properties window is open, it displays the names and values of the properties of the currently selected node in the 
Projects window. Depending on the type of object selected, you might see additional tabs for distinct categories of 
properties. </p>
<p>You can edit the values of most properties in the Properties window. 
To change a property value, click the property's value field. The appearance 
of the field changes depending on the type of value required:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a string value is required, the field becomes a text field. You can type the new value directly in 
this field and press Enter.</li>
<li>If a specific list of values is allowed, a drop-down arrow appears. You can click this arrow and 
select the value from the combo box that appears. You can also double-click the property name to 
rotate through the available values.</li>
<li>If a property editor is available for that property, an ellipsis (...) button appears. You 
can click the ellipsis button to open the property editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Property sheets appear elsewhere in the IDE, such as in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Options window</li>
<li>The Debugger window</li>
<li>The Form Editor, if your version of the IDE has the Form Editor module</li>
</ul>
<p>These property sheets display the properties 
for the selected node in the window.</p>
