<h2>Working with Unknown File Extensions</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>If you have a file of a type that the IDE does not recognize, you can have 
  register it as a known file type or have the IDE treat the file as a text file. 
  If the IDE treats a file as text, the file can be opened in the Source Editor. 
  Asking the IDE to treat a file as text does not alter the file itself in any 
  way.</p>
<p><b>To convert a file to text:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the filein the Projects window and choose Treat as Text.</li>
<p>You can then double-click that file's node to open the file in the Source Editor.</p>
</ul>

<p><b>To stop treating a file as text:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click the file and choose Tools <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Convert 
    to Default.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To register a file extension as belonging to a file type:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose Tools <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choose">&nbsp;Options.</li>
  <li>In the Options window, expand IDE Configuration <img src="../images/expand.gif" alt="and expand">&nbsp;System 
    <img src="../images/expand.gif" alt="and expand">&nbsp;Object Types.</li>
  <li>Select the node of the object type you want to add the file extension to.</li>
  <li>Select the Extensions and MIME Types property and add your extension to 
    the list.</li>
</ol>

  <tr> 
    <td valign="top"><img src="../images/tip.gif" alt="Tip"></td>
    <td valign=top align=left> 
      <p>When the IDE parses a file to identify its object type, it goes through 
        the list of object types in the order in which it appears in the Option 
        window until it finds a match. For example, since Ant scripts are also 
        XML documents, the IDE treats them as XML documents unless the Ant Scripts 
        object type appears before the XML Objects object type.</p>
      <p>Typically, it is best to leave the object types in their default order. 
        However, you may need to change the order to make the IDE correctly handle 
        your files. You can change the order of object type nodes by right-clicking 
        the Object Types node in the Options window and choosing Change Order.</p>
