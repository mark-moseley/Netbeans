        <h2>Working with Unknown File Extensions</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>If you want to work with a file of a type that the IDE does not recognize,
        you can associate it  with one of the file types that the IDE is familiar
        with.</p>


        <p><b>To register a file extension as belonging to a specific file type:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose Tools &gt; Options from the main menu and click Advanced Options in the Options window.</li>
            <li>In the left pane, expand IDE Configuration &gt; System &gt; Object Types.</li>
            <li>Select the node of the object type you want to add the file extension to.</li>
            <li>Select the Extensions and MIME Types property and add your extension to 
            the list.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note"> 
            <li> 
                For some object types, such as Java objects, it is not possible to add an extension.
            </li>
        </ul>
