<ol>
  <li>Select two files in the IDE.</li>
  <li>Right-click and choose Tools  &gt; Diff 
    from the contextual menu to run the diff command. 
    <p>By default, the graphical two-paned diff viewer displays the two files 
      side by side with the differences highlighted. 
  </li>
  <li>To change between the graphical diff viewer and the textual diff viewer, 
    use the Visualizer combo box: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Graphical Diff Viewer.</b> (Default) The graphical diff viewer uses 
        background highlight colors to display the differences between the two 
        files. By default, changed lines are highlighted in blue, added lines 
        are highlighted in green, and removed lines are highlighted in red. </li>
      <li><b>Textual Diff Viewer.</b> The textual diff viewer shows you the diff 
        output in text so that you can copy and paste the output into a file or 
        into an email. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each time you change a setting in the Visualizer combo box, the diff command 
      runs again with the new setting.</p>
  <li>To change between the built-in diff engine and the command-line diff engine, 
    use the Engine combo box: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Built-in Diff Engine.</b> (Default) The built-in diff engine allows 
        you to compare two files without your needing a command-line diff executable 
        installed on your system. </li>
      <li><b>Command-line Diff Engine.</b> Before you can use the command-line 
        diff engine on a Microsoft Windows system, you must have a command-line 
        diff executable (for example, from a Cygwin distribution) installed on 
        your system. For the UNIX<sup>&reg</sup> environment, there is a diff 
        executable installed and available to you by default. 
        <p> If you use the command-line diff engine, you can set <tt>diff</tt> 
          command options (for example, <tt>diff -b</tt>) in the diff settings 
          in the Options window. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each time you change a setting in the Engine combo box, the diff command 
      runs again with the new setting.</p>
</ol>
<H3>Configuring the Diff Viewer</H3>
<p>You can change the default diff settings in the Options window. </p>
<p> <b>To change diff viewer settings:</b> </p>
<ol>
  <li> Choose Tools &gt; Options and click the Classic View node at the bottom 
    of the Options window.</li>
  <li> Expand IDE Configuration&nbsp; &gt; Server and External Tools Settings.</li>
  <p> To set your default diff engine and default diff visualizer, select the 
    Diff Settings node. </p>
  <p> Expand the Diff and Merge Types node to set: 
  <ul>
    <li> Diff command options (for example, <tt>diff -b</tt>) </li>
    <li> The number of lines of context around differences in the textual diff 
      viewer </li>
    <li>The default background highlight colors for changed text in the graphical 
      diff viewer </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
