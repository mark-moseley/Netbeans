    <h2>Task List Window</h2>
    <p>The Task List window (known as the To Do window in previous versions of the 
        IDE) displays a unified list of things that you need to 
    resolve in your various files.</p>
    <p>You can click on an entries in 
        the Task List window to jump to the line of the file where 
    the task needs to be resolved.</p>
    <p>Task List window entries are created by some types of errors and by 
    the occurrence of specific character patterns in the file.</p>
    <p>The following are some of the things that create task list entries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Code comments that contain the patterns <tt>TODO</tt>, <tt>XXX</tt>, or <tt>FIXME</tt></li>
        <li>The pattern <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt>, which denotes merge conflicts in CVS and other 
        version control systems</li>
        <li>(For Java projects) Javadoc comments that contain the <tt>@todo</tt> keyword</li>
        <li>(For Java projects) lines where compiler errors are registered</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can do the following in the Task List window:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jump to a To Do task in the Source Editor.</li>
        <li>Sort and filter the list of To Do tasks displayed in the window.</li>
        <li>Create and modify To Do task filters.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>To open the Task List window, choose Window &gt; Task List (Ctrl-6) from the main menu.
        The Task List displays found TODO tasks.
        You can sort the list of tasks by clicking the column heading of the Task List.
    The Task List toolbar enables you to modify and work with the displayed TODO tasks.</p>



    
    <h3>Task List Window Toolbar</h3>
    <p>The Task List window toolbar has the following buttons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Current File.</b> When selected, the IDE scans the file that is 
        currently selected in the Source Editor and displays the To Do tasks found 
        in that file. When you open a new file in the editor, the file is scanned 
        and only the To Do tasks in that file are displayed.</li>
        <li><b>Main project and dependent projects.</b> When selected, the 
        IDE scans all files open in the Source Editor and displays all 
        tasks in the open files. When you open a file in the editor, the file is 
        scanned and the tasks in that file are added to the list of displayed tasks.</li>
        <li><b>All opened projects.</b> </li>
        <li><b>Filter.</b> You can click the drop-down list on this button to set 
        a filter on the items to be displayed. You can also create and modify filters.</li>
        <li><b>Group Tasks By Category.</b></li>
    </ul>
