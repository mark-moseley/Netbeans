<h2>Runtime Window</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Runtime window displays runtime information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active processes</li>
<li>History of VCS commands called in the current IDE session</li>
<li>The IDE's embedded HTTP server</li>
<li>Debugging sessions</li>
<li>External services connected to the IDE</li>
</ul> 

<p>The Processes node lists all processes currently being executed within 
  the IDE. You can terminate a running application by right-clicking its node 
  and choosing Terminate Process. This information also appears in the 
Execution view, which you can open by choosing 
Window <img src="../images/arrow.gif" alt="and choosing">&nbsp;Execution.</p>
<p>You can choose commands to start or stop the IDE's internal HTTP server by
right-clicking the HTTP Server node.
<p>The Debugger node has subnodes that contain information on breakpoints, watches, threads, and other aspects 
of a debugging session. You can add a new breakpoint by 
right-clicking the Breakpoints node and choosing New Breakpoint. You can add a new watch by right-clicking the 
Watches node and choosing New Watch. These features are also available in the Debugger window, which opens when 
you start debugging an application.</p>
<p>Other nodes may appear, depending on the modules that are installed in the
IDE. You can select a node and click F1 to view any help topic that might exist
for that node.</p>
