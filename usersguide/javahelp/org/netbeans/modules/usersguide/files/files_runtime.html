    <h2>Runtime Window</h2>
    <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
    <p>The Runtime window is the main entry point to your runtime resources. It shows 
    a logical view of important runtime resources such as the servers, databases, and
    web services that are registered with the IDE. 
    You can open the Runtime window by choosing Window  &gt; Runtime 
    (Ctrl-5).

    <h3>Runtime Resources</h3>
    <p>The following table lists the runtime resources as they appear in the Runtime 
    window, with their icons and their descriptions. 
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
        <tr align="left"> 
            <th scope="col"><b>Icon</b></th>
            <th scope="col"><b>Description</b></th>
        </tr>

            <td><img src="../images/runtime-window-servers.png"></td>
            <td><b>Servers</b>
            <br>Lists all servers currently registered with the IDE.
            For versions of the IDE that are bundled only with the Tomcat Web Server, 
            the Tomcat Web Server is automatically registered in the IDE. For versions of 
            the IDE that are bundled with both the Tomcat Web Server and Sun Java System Application Server, 
            both servers are automatically registered in the IDE. Use the IDE to
            <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.j2ee.platform/org/netbeans/modules/j2ee/platform/docs/server/server_register.html">register</a>
            all other servers.</td>

        <tr> 
            <td><img src="../images/runtime-window-processes.png"></td>
            <td><b>Processes</b>
            <br>Lists all processes currently being executed within 
            the IDE. You can terminate a running application by right-clicking its node
            and choosing Terminate Process. </td>

            <td><img src="../images/runtime-window-databases.png"></td>

            to the IDE.</td>

            <td><b>HTTP Server</b>
            <br>When you right-click the node, you can choose commands to start or stop the IDE's internal HTTP server.
            You can also <a href="../webbrowser/httpserver-options.html">configure HTTP server options</a>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
            <td><img src="../images/runtime-window-xmlentitycatalogs.png"></td>
            <td><b>DTD and XML Schema Catalogs</b>
            <br>Lists all of the <a href="../xml/catalog/xmlcatalog_about.html">XML Catalogs</a> that are 
            currently registered in the IDE.
