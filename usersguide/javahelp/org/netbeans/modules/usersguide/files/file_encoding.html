        <h2>About File Encodings</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

        <p>When creating a file for a project, the files are created using the specified
            <a href="../project/proj_encoding.html">project encoding</a>. Some file types
            declare the encoding in the file, e.g. HTML, JSP, and XML files. Therefore,
            when the IDE creates these files, it automatically includes character encoding
            declarations in the file template.</p>
            
        <p>When determining the character encoding for a file, the IDE applies the 
            FileEncodingQuery (FEQ) layer model. It first looks if the encoding is 
            declared in the file. If no encoding declaration can be found, the IDE
            presumes the file encoding is specified by the project's encoding property. 
            If the project encoding is not specified (e.g. imported or older projects), 
            the IDE applies the encoding set by the environment in which it runs.</p>

        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>The IDE does not convert characters when the encoding of the file changes.
                If you manually change the encoding declaration within the file, and that 
                encoding does not match the project encoding, you risk preventing the project 
                from compiling and running. This is due to the fact that the encoding tag 
                affects how file contents are viewed internally - not only during runtime,
                but during the design phase (i.e. adding content in a text editor) as well.</li>
