jsp, html and xml files and charset/encoding values  and how these interact with project encoding 

What is the file object feq ?

    * This is different for different file objects. Basically, there are some files, where the encoding is a part of the file, then the encoding should be obtained from the file through file object feq. If such encoding doesn't exist (in the file) the project encoding is used.
    * The FEQ is layer model which seems like this (priority is from top to down)

          o file feq

          o project feq (the value of the current global project encoding in a session)

          o fallback feq - the encoding of the locale the user who is running netbeans is in

    * When clients asks the FEQ for encoding of some file it goes from top to the bottom and asks the individual feq implementations.
          o First it asks the file feq, when the file is XML, HTML, JSP it looks inside the file and returns a content of encoding attribute if available otherwise it returns null.

When the file feq returned not null the FEQ returns the value to client otherwise it goes to the second step.

          o The second step it asks project feq implementation, when the file is inside some project which provides feq implementation the encoding of the project is returned to the client.

          o Finally if neither file feq nor project feq don't know anything about the file the fallback feq which returns the OS file encoding is used.

newly created jsp/html/ most xml files:

    * will have the encoding and/or meta  charset tag be that of the global project encoding, or if there is no global project encoding set (in the case of a project that does not implement feq) - the encoding of the locale user is in will be used.

    *   (if no project has been created yet, the global project encoding starts off as utf-8)

 **** Does this mean that global project encoding does not exist in projects that don't implement feq?

    *    if user changes project encoding, the next newly created jsp/html/xml  file will  use that encoding as value of its charset or encoding tags.

    *    but in this case, the charset/encoding tag of an already created  jsp/html/xml files in that project will still be used

              (unless and until user would actually change the file encoding/charset > tags in a given file.)
