/**
 * Event which provides granular data on setTabs() events which may contain
 * arbitrary differences, moves, additions and removals of array contents (or no
 * changes at all).
 * <p>
 * This event class is used in the case of calls to TabDataModel.setTabs(),
 * where one array of TabData objects is replaced with a different array of
 * TabData objects, which may contain additions, removals, deletions or moves.
 * The heavy lifting is done by <code>ArrayDiff</code>, which provides lists of
 * the affected indices for those things that are added/removed/changed/
 * deleted.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class should eventually be merged with ComplexListDataEvent, along with
 * some normalization of how things are done - it was written for expedience, not beauty.
