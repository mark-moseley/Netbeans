<project name="core/swing/tabcontrol" default="test-beanjar" basedir=".">

    <!-- Stuff here is only used when compiling a standalone jar
    of the tab control for use outside netbeans.  What you need:
        - A complete checkout of this module
        - A checkout of at least the dir src/org/openide/awt from the cvs
          module openide

    What it will do:
        - Copy the current version of the NetBeans fast HTML renderer into
          the beanstubs subdir
        - Compile it, along with a stub version of org.openide.ErrorManager
          which just prints to the console
        - Create a jar consisting of the tab control, the ErrorManager stub
          and the three classes that make up the HTML renderer
