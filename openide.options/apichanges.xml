        Should be source-compatible. Binary-incompatible for subclasses of
        <code>ContextSystemOption</code> directly accessing this field; but use
        of this field is probably unnecessary as <code>addOption</code> and
        <code>removeOption</code> are the normal public methods to manipulate
        the children. As of <date day="22" month="5" year="2001"/> the field is
        deprecated.
      </compatibility>
      <description>
        Protected field <code>beanContext</code> has changed type. The previous
        type was an inaccessible class, which was an API bug; it is now the
        public superclass.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>What do the Dates Mean?</h2>
<p>The supplied dates indicate when the API change was made, on the CVS
trunk. From this you can generally tell whether the change should be
present in a given build or not; for trunk builds, simply whether it
was made before or after the change; for builds on a stabilization
branch, whether the branch was made before or after the given date. In
some cases corresponding API changes have been made both in the trunk
and in an in-progress stabilization branch, if they were needed for a
bug fix; this ought to be marked in this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>release41</code> branch was made on Apr 03 '05 for use in the NetBeans 4.1 release.
Specification versions: 6.0 begins after this point.</li>
<li>The <code>release40</code> branch was made on Nov 01 '04 for use in the NetBeans 4.0 release.
Specification versions: 5.0 begins after this point.</li>
