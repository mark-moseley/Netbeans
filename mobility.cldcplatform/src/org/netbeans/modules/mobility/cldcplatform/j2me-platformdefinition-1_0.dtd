    An example how to use this DTD from your XML document:

    <?xml version='1.0'?>

    <!DOCTYPE platform PUBLIC '-//NetBeans//DTD J2ME PlatformDefinition 1.0//EN' 'http://www.netbeans.org/dtds/j2me-platformdefinition-1_0.dtd'>

    <platform>
    ...
    </platform>
-->

<!--- 
name - identification of the platform. The platform is always referenced by the name so the name must be unique among all installed platforms within the IDE
home - base folder of the platform installation
type - platform type.  Valid values are currently: UEI-1.0, UEI-1.0.1, and CUSTOM
displayname - displayed name of the platform. When not specified name is used instead
srcpath - optional list of folders, jars and zip files with platform sources
docpath - optional list of folders, jars, zip files and URLs containing platform JavaDoc
- all the paths are comma separated lists
- ${platform.home} can be used to reference the platform home directory

preverifycmd - command line used for preverification, this command line is used only when the platform type is set to CUSTOM
runcmd - command line used for emulator execution, this command line is used only when the platform type is set to CUSTOM
debugcmd - command line used for debugging, this command line is used only when the platform type is set to CUSTOM
- samples of UEI-1.0 command lines:
    preverifycmd: &quot;{platformhome}{/}bin{/}preverify&quot; {classpath|-classpath &quot;{classpath}&quot;} -d &quot;{destdir}&quot; &quot;{srcdir}&quot;
    runcmd: &quot;{platformhome}{/}bin{/}emulator&quot; {device|-Xdevice:&quot;{device}&quot;} {jadfile|-Xdescriptor:&quot;{jadfile}&quot;} {securitydomain|-Xdomain:{securitydomain}}
    debugcmd: &quot;{platformhome}{/}bin{/}emulator&quot; {device|-Xdevice:&quot;{device}&quot;} {jadfile|-Xdescriptor:&quot;{jadfile}&quot;} {securitydomain|-Xdomain:{securitydomain}} {debug|-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport={debugtransport},server={debugserver},suspend={debugsuspend},address={debugaddress}}
- format of the command lines (EMapFormat) is following:
    {argument|command line part} is a condition, if argument is set to some value the command line part will be added to the command line
    {argument} is a simple replacement, so for example {jadfile} will be replaced by the real path to the jad file
    combination of condition and simple replacement is allowed. For example: {jadfile|-Xdescriptor:&quot;{jadfile}&quot;} means that if the jadfile argument contains /myfolder/my.jad then -Xdescriptor:"/myfolder/my.jad" will be added to the command line
- known preverifycmd arguments:
    platformhome - always set - value of PlatformHome attribute
    srcdir - value of SrcDir attribute
    destdir - value of DestDir attribute
    classpath - classpath string composed from ClassPath, ClassPathRef, nested ClassPath
    / - value of File.separator
- known runcmd and debugcmd arguments:
    platformhome - always set - value of PlatformHome attribute
    device - value of Device attribute
    classpath - classpath string composed from ClassPath, ClassPathRef, nested ClassPath
    jadfile - value of JadFile attribute
    jadurl - value of JadUrl attribute
    securitydomain - value of SecurityDomain attribute
    debug - value of Debug attribute, this is just a switch that indicates debugging
    debugaddress - value of DebugAddress attribute
    debugtransport - value of DebugTransport attribute
    debugserver - value of DebugServer attribute. Default: true.
    debugsuspend - value of DebugSuspend attribute. Default: true.
    / - value of File.separator
