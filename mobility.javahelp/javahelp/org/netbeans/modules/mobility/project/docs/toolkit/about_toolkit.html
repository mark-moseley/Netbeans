<h2>About the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See also</a></small></p>
<p>The Sun Java Wireless Toolkit is a collection of tools and device emulators that 
  support the development of Java applications that run on devices compliant with 
  the Mobile Device Information Profile (MIDP). Such devices include cellular 
  phones, two-way pagers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). </p>
<p>The Sun Java Wireless Toolkit  is installed in the NetBeans IDE as
  the default emulator.</p>
<p> The Toolkit uses the Java SDK, Standard 
  Edition (J2SE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> SDK) compiler to compile your 
  source files and provides device emulators to simulate the performance of a 
  MIDP application, as well as tools that help you monitor and improve the performance 
  of your application.</p>
<p>The Wireless Toolkit supports testing with several key features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Wireless Toolkit can simulate several devices that take on a variety 
    of form factors: cell phones, pagers, and palmtops. This helps you learn what 
    type of experience users can expect and verify the portability of your application 
    across different devices. </li>
  <li> The Wireless Toolkit supports tracing and debugging with run-time logging 
    of various events, such as garbage collection, class loading, method calls, 
    and exceptions. You can also perform source-level debugging with an IDE while 
    an application runs in the Wireless Toolkit. </li>
  <li> The Wireless Toolkit enables you to collect information that you can examine 
    to optimize the performance of your MIDP applications. Performance tuning 
    utilities include profiling methods and monitoring memory usage and network 
    traffic. Also included is the ability to adjust the speed settings for graphic 
  rendering and refreshing as well as VM speed emulation and network throughput. </li>
  <li>The new Java Wireless Toolkit includes support for the Mobile Service Architecture platform as well as Nokia's Scalable Network Application Package (SNAP) Mobile API. </li>
</ul>
<p> You can access the preferences and utilities of the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit
  in the Tools &amp; Extensions tab of the Java Platform Manager. </p>
