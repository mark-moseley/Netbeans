<h6>MIDlet Suite</h6>
<p>A MIDP application, or <em>MIDlet</em>, is deployed as a MIDlet suite. A MIDlet 
  suite is a combination of a JAR file that collects the MIDlets and the associated 
  files necessary to create the MIDP application, and a Java Application Descriptor 
  (JAD) file that identifies the application to target devices. A MIDlet suite 
  can be built, executed, and deployed to mobile devices.</p>
<p>A MIDlet suite includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A Java Application Descriptor (JAD) file. This file contains a predefined
    set of attributes (denoted by names that begin with <tt>MIDlet-</tt>) that
    allows Application Management Software (AMS) to identify, retrieve, and install
    the MIDlets. </li>
  <li>A Java Archive (JAR) file. This contains:
      <ul>
        <li>Java classes for each MIDlet in the suite. </li>
        <li> Java classes shared between MIDlets. </li>
        <li>Resource files used by the MIDlets (for example, image files). </li>
        <li>A manifest file describing the JAR contents and specifying attributes
          used by AMS to identify and install the MIDlet suite. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
