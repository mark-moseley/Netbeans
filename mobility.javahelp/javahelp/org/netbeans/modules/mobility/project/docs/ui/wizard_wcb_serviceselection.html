<h2>Mobile Client to Web Application Generator<br>
  Web Service Operations/Methods in Web Project Page</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Use the Mobile Client to Web Application Generator to generate a servlet which 
  connects to a web application that includes a web service client. This type 
  of connection utilizes three &quot;tiers&quot;: client, web application or servlet, 
  and server. The client communicates with the generated middleware servlet using 
  a proprietary communication protocol. The servlet and server communicate using 
  standard Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages. </p>
<p>You open the Mobile Client to Web Application Generator by selecting a project 
  then choosing File &gt; New File and selecting Mobile Client to Web Application 
  from the MIDP Category. </p>
<p>The Web Service Operations page reads the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) 
  file from the application you specified on the previous page and displays a 
  list of the available Web services. You must select at least one service for 
  the Mobile client to use.</p>
<p>The Methods in Web Project page lists the methods that are available within 
  the application you specified in the previous page. You must select at least 
  one method for the Mobile client to use.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>If services and methods are listed but you can not check any of the checkboxes, 
    you might need to download additional libraries to activate the Web Service 
    Registry when running on JDK 1.4. See Web Service Registry help for more information.
