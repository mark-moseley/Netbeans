    <h2>CDC Project Properties Dialog Box: Run</h2>
    <p>The Running Project page lets you configure options for running your CDC project. You can set the 
    class and its type (main, applet, xlet) to execute and program arguments. You
    can also specify a space-separated list of VM options in this panel. You open the
    CDC Project Properties dialog box by right-clicking any 
    CDC project node and choosing Properties.
    <p><b>Notes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The Browse button for the Main Class field only shows executable classes in the project's 
        source folders. For a CDC project this means all classes with a static main method, or classes extending
        the Applet or Xlet classes. </li>
        <li>Arguments are passed only to the main class, not to individual files. In case of Xlet execution
        all arguments are passed to all Xlets specified.</li>
    </ul>
