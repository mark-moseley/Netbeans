<h6>CLDC (Connected Limited Device Configuration)</h6>
<p>For the Java ME platform, CLDC defines the basic configuration (Java language,
  virtual machine features, and essential class libraries) for a category of
  devices that include cell phones, two-way pagers, and similar devices. These
devices share the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They contain 128KB to 512KB total memory.</li>
  <li>They have a limited power source, such as a battery.</li>
  <li>They can be connected to a network.</li>
  <li>They have relatively constrained user interfaces, usually text-only.</li>
</ul>
<p>CLDC 1.1 is a revised version of the CLDC 1.0 specification, and includes
  new features such as floating point and weak reference support, in additional
  to other enhancements. </p>
<p>The requirements for CLDC 1.0 are specified in detail in Java Specification
  Request (JSR) 30. </p>
<p>The requirements for CLDC 1.1 are specified in detail in JSR 139.</p>
