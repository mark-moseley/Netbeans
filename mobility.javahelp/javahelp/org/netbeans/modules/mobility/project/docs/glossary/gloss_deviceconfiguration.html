<p>A project configuration in NetBeans defines the execution environment for
  a Java ME MIDP application that simulates a specific mobile device. You can define
  multiple project configurations for an application, then embed preprocessor
  blocks within
  your
  code to take advantage of the specific functions of each configuration. </p>
<p>Properties that are defined in a project configuration include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>emulator platform</li>
  <li>specific emulator device</li>
  <li>supported version of the Connected Limited Device Configuration
      (CLDC)</li>
