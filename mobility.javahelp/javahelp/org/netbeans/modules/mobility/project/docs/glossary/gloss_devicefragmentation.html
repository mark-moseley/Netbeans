<h6>device fragmentation</h6>
<p>The situation that arises when vendor-specific, proprietary, or optional APIs
  are added to mobile devices to expand device functionality. Other device attributes,
  such as screen size, color depth, available memory, and others, also contribute
  to device fragmentation, which makes it  difficult to write a single
  application that will run on all targeted devices.</p>
