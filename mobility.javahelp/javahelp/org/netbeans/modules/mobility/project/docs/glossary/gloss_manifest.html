<h6>JAR manifest</h6>
<p>A file contained in every MIDP JAR that describes the contents of the archive.
  The manifest file contains extra information that is important to the MIDP
  runtime environment, such as the MIDlet's class name, and the versions of CLDC
  and MIDP that it supports. </p>
<p>NetBeans generates this file automatically when you create a Java ME MIDP project. </p>
