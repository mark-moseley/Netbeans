<h6>Game Builder: Tiled Layers</h6>
<p>Tiled Layers are a layer type for creating scenes in the Game builder module. When you create a tiled layer you can specify the height and width of the square and choose the image you want to use to produce a visual background to the game scene. The advantage of tiling the images is that you get a full background without using a large file size image.</p>
