        <li><b>Generate Debugging Info.</b> The compiler will include information neccessary for debugging
        in the compiled class files.</li>
        <li><b>Report Uses of Deprecated APIs.</b>During the compilation process you will be informed about
        places in your code where you are calling/using obsolete API.</li>
