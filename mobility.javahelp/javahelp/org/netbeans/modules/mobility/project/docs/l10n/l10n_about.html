<h2>About Java ME MIDP Localization Support</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

<p>Localization is the process of designing software so that it can be
  adapted (localized) to various languages and regions without engineering changes
  to the software. When you localize
  an application, you provide alternate language values for each element in your
  application, such as screen text, menus, and icons. </p>
<p>In  the NetBeans IDE, you can use the <a href="../ui/wizard_newlocalization_name.html">New
    Localization Support Class wizard</a> to create the
  files you need to localize an application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Java class file that initiates localization support
    based on the currently set locale (obtained from the <tt>microedition.locale</tt> system
  property). </li>
  <li>A property resource bundle (with the extension (<code>.properties</code>)
    that contains the element keys and their values. Inside the property resource
    bundle, elements
    are
    listed
    as
    key/value
    pairs,
    for
    example: 
    <pre>
  TEXT_NOT_FOUND=No text available for this locale. 
  TEXT_HELLO=Hello, world!
  TEXT_WARNING=There are {0} warnings in the file {1}.
  BUTTON_FINISH=Finish</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>After you create the key/value pairs for your application, you can then
  use the <code>getMessage()</code> method
  within your code to prove the proper value for the called key. The initialization
  method is called automatically when a call to the <code>getMessage(java.lang.String)</code> method
  is attempted for the first time. </p>
<p>For example, <code>LocalizationSupport.getMessage(&quot;TEXT_HELLO&quot;)</code></p>
<ul class="note"><li>To see an example of a localized project, Choose
      File &gt; New
      Project. Under Categories, expand the Samples node and choose Mobile. Under
      Projects, choose Localization Support Example.</li>
  </ul>
