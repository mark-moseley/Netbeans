<h6>application management software (AMS)</h6>
<p>Application Management Software (AMS) is a software application that comes
  with the Mobile Information Device Platform (MIDP) implementation and controls
  the installation, execution, and
removal of MIDlets by a device. </p>
<p>The specific implementation differs between devices, but in general the AMS
  provides the following services: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Provides methods for installing and uninstalling MIDlets from wireless
    devices, either through a serial cable connected to a PC, or remotely through
    the internet.</li>
  <li>Provides system resources such as (Connected, Limited Device Connection)
    (CLDC) classes, MIDP classes, and the KVM. AMS also makes all the classes
    resource files,
    and
    Java Application
    Descriptor
    files available to the MIDlet at runtime.</li>
  <li>Handles installation and runtime errors.</li>
