<h2>New Mobile Designer Component Wizard</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>Use the New Mobile Designer Component Wizard to create all of the necessary elements for adding a new custom component to the Visual Mobile Designer Palatte such as a branded splashscreen component. ge is the last page of this wizard.</p>
<p>In this page, you specify the: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Name and location of the client to be created.</li>
  <li>Types of code to be generated for the client.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="note"><li>If you want to re-generate the client and servlet files with different options, you do not have to re-create them in this wizard. You can click on the Settings file to change the options and regenerate the files.</li></ul>
<p>To specify the name and location of the generated servlet, enter information 
  in the following fields: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Client Name.</strong> Name for the client file to be generated. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>Package.</strong> Package where the class will be located. </li>
</ul>
<p>Then choose from the following options. </p>
    
<ul>
  <li><strong>Generate stubs. </strong>Generates stub (client-side proxy) methods 
    on the client for each exported service. Method names are incorporated in 
    the class name. Using<tt> HelloService</tt> for example, the <tt>sayHello()</tt> 
    method is exported. The generated stub method creates a method on the client 
    called <tt>example_HelloService_sayHello().</tt> If this option is not selected, 
    only one method is generated on the client.</li>
  <li><strong>Generate grouped calls. </strong>Generates additional code to support 
    making multiple calls to server-side services in a single HTTP request and 
    response. When turned on with the Generate Stub Methods option also turned 
    on, a generated method is created on the client for each exported service 
    with the stub method name ending in <tt>Grouped</tt>. Using <tt>HelloService</tt> 
    for example, the <tt>sayHello()</tt> method is exported. The generated stub 
    method<br>
    creates a method on the client called <tt>example_HelloService_sayHelloGrouped()</tt>. 
    <p> When the option is selected, the server is called only after several 
      grouped calls are made and the <tt>getGroupedResults() </tt>method on the 
      client class is called. All the method calls are invoked in a single HTTP 
      request and response. Methods are invoked in the order they were called. 
      Results are returned in an enumeration object. </p>
    <p>If a server call causes an exception, the exception is thrown when <tt>getGroupedResults()</tt> 
      is called. When an exception is thrown in a sequence of grouped calls, the 
      calls following the exception are not processed. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Allow floating point.</strong> Activates support for float and double 
    data types.</li>
  <li><strong>Generate tracing code.</strong> Generates tracing code that provides 
    runtime information during the execution of remote calls. Client tracing output 
    goes to the MIDP implementation standard output. Server tracing output goes 
    to the server log file. Turn this option on to generate versions of client 
    and server tracing code to help you if connection problems occur between the 
    client and the server. </li>
  <li>Optionally, choose Create sample MIDlet to create a sample MIDlet that can 
    connect to the Web service. </li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking Finish generates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Java ME client class</li>
  <li>A servlet and supporting classes</li>
  <li>A settings file in xml format that can be used to regenerate the server 
    and Java ME client classes.</li>
  <li>Optionally, a MIDlet you can examine and modify. </li>
</ul>
