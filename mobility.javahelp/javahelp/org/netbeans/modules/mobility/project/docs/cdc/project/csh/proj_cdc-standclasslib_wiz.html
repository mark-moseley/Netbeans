<h2>New CDC Class Library Wizard: Name and Location </h2>
<p>The New CDC Class Library wizard enables you to create a new 
  CDC project with no main (executable) class. 
  You open the wizard by opening the New Project wizard
  and selecting  the CDC Class Library Template 
  from the CDC category. 
<p>In the Name and Location page, you have to set the following properties:
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Name. </b>Specifies the display name of the project. This name 
    is also used to create the project folder.</li>
  <li><b>Project Location. </b>Specifies the folder where you want to store the 
    project metadata and source code. When you create an empty CDC project, you 
    cannot store the project folder and the project source code in separate locations 
    like you can with projects from existing source code.</li>
</ul>
When you click Finish, the project is created on your computer and opened in both 
the Projects window and the Files window.
