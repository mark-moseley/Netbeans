<h2>Using the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit Utilities</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See also</a></small></p>
<p>The Sun Java Wireless Toolkit is a collection of tools and device emulators that
  support the development of Java applications that run on devices compliant
  with the
  Mobile
  Device Information
Profile (MIDP). Such devices include mobile phones, two-way pagers, and personal
  digital assistants (PDAs). The Wireless Toolkit is installed as the default
  emulator in the NetBeans IDE. </p>
<p> The Wireless Toolkit supports testing with several key features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Wireless Toolkit can simulate several devices that take on a variety 
    of form factors: cell phones, pagers, and palmtops. This helps you learn what 
    type of experience users can expect and verify the portability of your application 
    across different devices. </li>
  <li> The Wireless Toolkit supports tracing and debugging with run-time logging 
    of various events, such as garbage collection, class loading, method calls, 
    and exceptions. You can also perform source-level debugging with an IDE while 
    an application runs in the Wireless Toolkit. </li>
  <li> The Wireless Toolkit enables you to collect information that you can examine 
    to optimize the performance of your MIDP applications. Performance tuning 
    utilities include profiling methods and monitoring memory usage and network 
    traffic. Also included is the ability to adjust the speed settings for graphic 
    rendering and refreshing as well as VM speed emulation and network throughput. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>To use the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit utilities:</strong></p>
