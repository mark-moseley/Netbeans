<h2>About CDC Emulator Platforms</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

<p>An emulator platform simulates the execution of an application on one or more 
  target devices. For example, the Java ME SDK 3.0 enables you to run Foundation Profile, 
  Personal Basis Profile, AGUI and BD-J CDC applications. RUnning the application in an  
  emulator allows you to understand the user experience for an application on a particular 
  device, and to test the portability of the application across different devices. </p>
<p>In the IDE, you specify the emulator platform in the project properties. Many 
  emulator platforms are packaged as software developer kits (SDKs) from manufacturers 
  of mobile devices. </p>
<p> Some of the differences between emulators include their support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Profiles such as Foundation or Personal Profile </li>
  <li>Devices, or &quot;skins&quot;</li>
  <li>Optional packages and APIs</li>
  <li>Monitoring and testing tools</li>
</ul>
  <p>Note that having an emulator does eliminate the need for testing your application on the actual 
  target devices. An emulator can only approximate a device's user interface, 
  functionality, and performance. For example, an emulator may not accurately simulate 
  processing speed, so an application may run faster, or slower, on a target device 
  than it does on an emulator.</p>
