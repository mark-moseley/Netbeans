<h2>About Emulator Platforms</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

<p>An emulator platform simulates the execution of an application on one or more 
  target devices. For example, the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit enables you to run applications 
  on several example devices, or &quot;skins&quot; included with the emulator. 
  An emulator allows you to understand the user experience for an application 
  on a particular device, and to test the portability of the application across 
  different devices. </p>
<p>In the IDE, you specify the emulator platform as part of the overall project
  configuration. Many emulator platforms are packaged as software developer kits
  (SDKs) from manufacturers
  of mobile
  devices.  </p>
<p> Some of the differences between emulators include their support for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>versions of MIDP and CLDC.</li>
  <li>devices, or &quot;skins.&quot;</li>
  <li>optional packages and APIs.</li>
  <li>monitoring and testing tools.</li>
</ul>
  <p>You can access the special tools and extensions of an emulator platform
    by choosing the Tools and Extensions tab in the Java Platform Manager. </p>
  <p>Note that having an emulator does not completely free you from testing
    on your target devices. An emulator can only approximate a device's user
    interface,
      functionality, and performance. For example, an emulator might not simulate
      processing speed, so an application may run faster or slower on a target
    device than it does on an emulator.</p>
