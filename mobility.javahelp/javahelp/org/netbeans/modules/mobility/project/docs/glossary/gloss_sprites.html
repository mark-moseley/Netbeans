<h6>Game Builder: Sprites </h6>
<p>Sprites are a layer type for creating scenes in the Game builder module. Sprites 
  are typically characters or another active type of character in a game so the 
  visual representation of the sprite is on the top layer of the game.</p>
<p>Small, animated bitmap images in a game that act according to pre-set rules 
  that define how they react to the game player's actions, other sprites, or other 
  objects in the game environment. </p>
