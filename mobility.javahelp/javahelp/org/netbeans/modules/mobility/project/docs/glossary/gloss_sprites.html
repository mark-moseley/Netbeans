<h6>Game Builder: Sprites</h6>
<p>Sprites are a layer type for creating scenes in the Game Builder module. Sprites are typically 
characters or other animated objects in a game. The sprite is displayed on the top layer of the game. 
Sprites include small, animated images  that act according to pre-defined rules that determine how 
they react to a player's actions, other sprites, or other objects in the game environment. </p>
