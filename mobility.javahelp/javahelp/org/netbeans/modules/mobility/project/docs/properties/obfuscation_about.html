<h2>About Obfuscation</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>

<p>Performance and security are primary concerns for any application. Because
  the Java language was designed to be compiled into a platform-independent bytecode
  format, much of the information contained in the source code remains in the
  bytecode, making it easy to decompile or reverse-engineer a Java application.
  This format can also contribute to larger file sizes, and with the limited
  resources of mobile devices, every byte saved in a MIDP application counts
towards mobility and performance.</p>
<p>Obfuscators use a variety of methods to transform compiled code. Code obfuscation
  techniques include stripping object code of its symbol tables, or altering
  the names of variables and identifiers. Obfuscated programs are not only more
  difficult to decompile or reverse-engineer, they are also frequently smaller
  in size, improving performance and mobility as well as security. </p>
<p>You can add additional obfuscation parameters in the Addtional Obfuscation
    Settings window. <br>
The default obfuscator included with the IDE is ProGuard. 
<p>You can find more
    details about command parameters for this obfuscator at:
