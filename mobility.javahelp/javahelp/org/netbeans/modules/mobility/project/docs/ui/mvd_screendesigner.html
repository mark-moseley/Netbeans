<h2>Screen Designer</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Screen Designer enables you to customize screens that have been added
  to the flow of your application in the <a href="mvd_flowdesigner.html">Flow
  Designer </a>window.</p>
<p>The Screen Designer window opens when you double-click on a Screen icon in 
  the Flow Designer window. The Screen Designer has two main sections: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Device Screen</li>
  <li>Assigned Commands</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Device Screen</strong></p>
<p>The Device Screen simulates how the component appears on a real device.
  All components appear in the
  order they are listed in the <a href="mvd_inspector.html">Inspector view</a>.</p>
<p>  New components can be dragged and dropped directly to the desired location
  of the Device Screen. Only components that are valid for the screen type can
be added. </p>
<p>To change the size of a Device Screen, right-click on the Device Screen
  and choose Set Screen Size. This opens a dialog where you
  can set the height and width
  of
  the device
screen in pixels. </p>
<p><strong>Assigned Commands</strong></p>
<p>This portion of the Screen Designer shows all the Transition Sources attached
to the screen. You can select the box to display and edit the properties of the
  Transaction Source in the <a href="mvd_properties.html">Properties view</a>.</p>
