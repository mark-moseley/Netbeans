<h2>Screen Designer</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>The Screen Designer enables you to customize screens that have been added
  to the flow of your application in the <a href="mvd_flowdesigner.html">Flow
  Designer </a>window.</p>
<p>The Screen Designer window opens when you double-click on a Screen icon in 
  the Flow Designer window. The Screen Designer has two main sections: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Device Screen</li>
  <li>Assigned Resources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Device Screen</strong></p>
<p>The Device Screen simulates how the component appears on a real device. All 
  components appear in the order they are listed in the <a href="mvd_inspector.html">Navigator 
  view</a>.</p>
<p> New components can be dragged and dropped directly to the desired location 
  of the Device Screen. Only components that are valid for the screen type can 
  be added. </p>
<p><strong>Assigned Resources</strong></p>
<p>This portion of the Screen Designer shows all the assigned commands, assigned 
  item commands, and resources attached to the screen. You can select the box 
  to display and edit the properties of the Transaction Source in the <a href="mvd_properties.html">Properties 
  view</a>.</p>
