<h6>Game Designer: Scenes</h6>
<p>Scenes are locations within a game environment that have distinctive visual, and possibly audio, characteristics that define the games look and feel. Each 
  level in a game can have several different scenes. Conversely, a simple game 
  may have only one scene for all of its levels. These choices are up to the game 
  developer and can also depend on the   ability of target devices to run 
  complex, memory and processor intensive applications.</p>
