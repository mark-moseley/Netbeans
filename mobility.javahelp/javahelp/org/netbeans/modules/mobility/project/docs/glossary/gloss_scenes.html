<h6>Game Builder: Scenes</h6>
<p>Scenes are a specific location within the mileau of a J2ME game. Each level of a game can have several different scenes. Conversely, a simple game may have only one scene for all of its levels. Such choices are up to the game designer and are closely related to the target devices abilities to deploy complex and resource intensive applications.</p>
