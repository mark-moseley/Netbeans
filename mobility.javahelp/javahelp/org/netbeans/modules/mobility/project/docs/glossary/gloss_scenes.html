<h6>Game Builder: Scenes</h6>
<p>Scenes are a specific location within the environment of a Java ME game. Each 
  level of a game can have several different scenes. Conversely, a simple game 
  may have only one scene for all of its levels. Such choices are up to the game 
  designer and are closely related to the ability of target devices to deploy 
  complex and resource-intensive applications.</p>
