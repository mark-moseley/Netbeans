    <h2>New CDC Application Wizard: Existing Sources</h2>
    <p>The New CDC Project with Existing Sources wizard enables you to create
    a new 
    CDC project from an existing CDC source folder. You open the wizard by 
    opening the New Project wizard and selecting the 
    CDC Application with Existing Sources template from the CDC category. 
    <p>On the Existing Sources page, you have to set the following properties: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Source Packages Folder. </b>Specifies the folder that contains the CDC
        source code for the project. You must set the Source Packages Folder to the
        folder that contains the default package.</li>
        <li><b>Test Packages Folder (Optional). </b>Specifies the folder that contains
        the JUnit test suites for the project. You must set the Test Packages Folder
        to the folder that contains the default package.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you click Finish, the project is created on your computer and opened in 
    both the Projects window and the Files window. </p>
    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each CDC Project with Existing Sources can only contain one source packages 
        folder and its corresponding test packages folder. To work with multiple source 
        folders, you have to create a separate project for each source folder and 
        create build dependencies between the projects.</li>
