    <h2>New CDC Application Wizard: Name and Location </h2>
    
<p>The New CDC Application wizard enables you to create a new CDC application 
  with a main class and will also generate a unique UID for the application. You 
  open the wizard by opening the New Project wizard and selecting the CDC Application 
  template from the CDC category. 
<p>In the Name and Location page, you can set the following properties: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Name. </b>Specifies the display name of the project. This name 
    is also used to create the project folder.</li>
  <li><b>Project Location. </b>Specifies the folder where you want to store the 
    project metadata and source code. When you create an empty Java project, you 
    cannot store the project folder and the project source code in separate locations 
    like you can with projects from existing source code.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Folder.</strong> </li>
  <li><b>Set as Main Project.</b> Sets the newly created project as the main project.</li>
  <li><b>Create Main Class.</b> Specifies the package and name of the main class. 
    You should enter the fully qualified name of the class without the <tt>.java 
    </tt>extension (for example, <tt>com.me.MyClass</tt>).</li>
</ul>
When you click Finish, the project is created on your computer and opened in both 
the Projects window and the Files window.
