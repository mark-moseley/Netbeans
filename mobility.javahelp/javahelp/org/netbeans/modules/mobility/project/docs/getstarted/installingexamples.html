<h2>Installing MIDP Examples</h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
<p>You can use the example Java ME MIDP projects included with the NetBeans IDE
  to learn about Java ME coding and APIs supported by this IDE. </p>
<p><strong>To install a project: </strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Chose File &gt; New Project.</li>
  <li>Under Categories, expand the Samples folder and then expand  the
    Mobile folder. <br>
    The Mobility projects are organized into different categories:
    <ul>
      <li>Projects that  support only MIDP 1.0 devices</li>
      <li>Projects that that take advantage of  MIDP 2.0 features</li>
      <li>Projects that illustrate the creation of mobile applications that consume
        Web services. These examples were created using the <a href="../wcw/wcw_creating.html">Wireless
        Connection Wizard</a>. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select a folder, then under Projects, select an example, and click the
    Next button. </li>
  <li>In the Project Name and Location page, choose a name and projects home
    directory for your project. <br>
    The projects home directory should be where you want to store all your
    projects.</li>
  <li>If you want the project to be your main project, leave the checkbox
      selected. Click Next.</li>
  <li>In the Platform Selection page, choose the emulator platform you want to
    use to execute the application. </li>

<ul>
  <li>If the emulator supports more than one device emulator, choose a device
        from the dropdown menu. </li>
  <li>If the emulator supports more than one version of  CLDC or MIDP, choose
        the appropriate radio button. 
    <ul class="note"><li>Certain examples
              require MIDP 2.0, and can not be executed if you are using an emulator
              platform that does not support MIDP 2.0.</li>
      </ul>
  </li></ul>
  <li>Click Finish to install the Project. <br>
    The project displays in the Projects window. You can also examine the project's
      contents in the Files window. </li>
</ol>
