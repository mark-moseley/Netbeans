<h2>About MIDP Projects</h2>
<p>A project is a group of source files and the settings with which you build, 
  run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all Java development has to take 
  place within a project. Within a MIDP project, you can create multiple project 
  configurations that customize your MIDlet for different types of mobile devices. 
</p>
<p>The IDE builds its project infrastructure directly on top of Apache Ant, the
  leading build tool for Java applications. The IDE stores all of the information
  about your project in an Ant script, a properties file, and a few XML configuration
  files. This means that you can build and run your projects outside of the IDE
exactly the same as inside the IDE.</p>
<p>When a project is created, the IDE: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Creates a source tree you can examine in the Projects or Files views.</li>
  <li>Sets the emulator platform for the project. </li>
  <li>Sets the project run and compile-time classpaths.</li>
  <li>Creates a build script that contains actions for running, compiling, debugging,
    and building Javadoc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MIDP project structure is similar to that of standard NetBeans <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.java.helpset/org/netbeans/modules/java/helpset/docs/project/proj_about.html">projects</a>. 
  There are differences, however, in the <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code> 
  folders to accommodate the MIDP build process. </p>
<p>When a project is created, the following folders are created under <code>build</code> : </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>compiled.</code> Contains all compiled classes.</li>
  <li><code>preprocessed.</code> Holds the source files after they are preprocessed. 
    The files will differ from the original source files if you are using project 
    configurations. </li>
  <li><code>obfuscated.</code> Holds the obfuscated versions of the class files.</li>
  <li><code>preverified</code>. Holds the preverified versions of the class files. 
    These files are packaged into the distribution JAR of your project. </li>
</ul>
