<h6>Game Designer: Game Designer Module </h6>
<p>The Game Designer is based on the MIDP 2.0 <code>javax.microedition.lcdui.game </code>package. This gaming API has five classes that enable developers to create games for MIDP 2.0 enabled mobile devices. The classes were created with ease of development, small application size, and  performance in mind.</p>
