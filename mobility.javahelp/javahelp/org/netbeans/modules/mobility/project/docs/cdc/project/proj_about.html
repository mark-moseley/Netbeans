<h2>About CDC Projects</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>A project is a group of source files and the settings with which you build, 
  run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all Java development has to take 
  place within a project. </p>
<p>The IDE builds its project infrastructure directly on top of Apache Ant, the
  leading build tool for Java applications. The IDE stores all of the information
  about your project in an Ant script, a properties file, and a few XML configuration
  files. This means that you can build and run your projects outside of the IDE
exactly the same as inside the IDE.</p>
<p>When a project is created, the IDE: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Creates a source tree you can examine in the Projects or Files views.</li>
  <li>Sets the emulator platform for the project. </li>
  <li>Sets the project run and compile-time classpaths.</li>
  <li>Creates a build script that contains actions for running, compiling, debugging, 
    and building Javadoc. 
</ul>
<p>CDC applications are called <em>xlets</em>. The xlet application programming 
  model is very similar to the applet application programming model. Xlets are 
  loaded into an xlet manager and controlled through a life cycle interface. This 
  is similar to how an applet is loaded and run inside a browser. The main difference 
  is that the xlet application programming model does not have implicit API requirements 
  like<code> java.applet</code>, which allows it to be used in a greater variety 
  of product scenarios.</p>
<p>The MIDP project structure is similar to that of standard NetBeans <a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.java.helpset/org/netbeans/modules/java/helpset/docs/project/proj_about.html">projects</a>. 
  There are differences, however, in the <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code> 
  folders to accommodate the MIDP build process. </p>
<p><strong>Logical View</strong></p>
<p>The logical view of the project, shown in the Projects window, shows the source 
  package, resources, and <a href="../../configuration/config_about.html">project 
  configurations</a> that you have created. </p>
<p>By right-clicking on the project node, you can choose the following Mobility-specific 
  menu items: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Batch Build.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select multiple 
    configurations. The IDE then builds a distribution JAR for each configuration 
    you select. </li>
  <li><strong>Batch Clean &amp; Build.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select 
    multiple configurations. The IDE then cleans and builds a distribution JAR 
    file for each configuration you select. </li>
  <li><strong>Batch Clean.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select multiple 
    configurations. The IDE then cleans the build files for each configuration 
    you select. </li>
  <li><strong>Batch Deploy.</strong> Opens a dialog that lets you select multiple 
    configurations. The IDE then <a href="../../deploy/about_deployment.html">deploys</a> 
    your application according to the deployment properties set in each configuration 
    you select.</li>
  <li><strong>Run With.</strong> Opens the Quick Project Run dialog. In this dialog, 
    you can select a device &quot;on the fly&quot; on which to test your application. 
    The IDE runs your application on the selected platform, but does not build 
    the project or create a distribution JAR for that platform. </li>
</ul>
<p>Right-clicking on the Source Package node and choosing New lets you add new 
  <a href="../../projects/proj_templates.html">file templates</a> to your application. </p>
<p>Right-clicking the Resources node enables you to add Project, JARs, folders, 
  and libraries as resources for your application. </p>
<p><strong>Files View</strong></p>
<p>When a project is created, the following folders are created under <code>build</code> 
  (shown in the Files window): </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>compiled.</code> Contains all compiled classes.</li>
  <li><code>preprocessed.</code> Holds the source files after they are preprocessed. 
    The files will differ from the original source files if you are using project 
    configurations. </li>
  <li><code>obfuscated.</code> Holds the obfuscated versions of the class files.</li>
  <li><code>preverified</code>. Holds the preverified versions of the class files. 
    These files are packaged into the distribution JAR of your project. </li>
  <li><code>preverifysrc.</code>Versions of the source files before they are preverified.</li>
</ul>
