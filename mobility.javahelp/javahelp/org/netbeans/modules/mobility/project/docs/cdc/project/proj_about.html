<h2>About CDC Projects</h2>
<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small>
<p>A project is a group of source files and the settings with which you build, 
  run, and debug those source files. In the IDE, all Java development has to take 
  place within a project. </p>
<p>The IDE builds its project infrastructure directly on top of Apache Ant, the
  leading build tool for Java applications. The IDE stores all of the information
  about your project in an Ant script, a properties file, and a few XML configuration
  files. This means that you can build and run your projects outside of the IDE
exactly the same as inside the IDE.</p>
<p>When a project is created, the IDE: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Creates a source tree you can examine in the Projects or Files views.</li>
  <li>Sets the emulator platform for the project. </li>
  <li>Sets the project run and compile-time classpaths.</li>
  <li>Creates a build script that contains actions for running, compiling, debugging, 
    and building Javadoc. 
</ul>
<p>CD applications are called <em>xlets</em>. The xlet application programming 
  model is very similar to the applet application programming model. Xlets are 
  loaded into an xlet manager and controlled through a life cycle interface. This 
  is similar to how an applet is loaded and run inside a browser. The main difference 
  is that the xlet application programming model does not have implicit API requirements 
  like<code> java.applet</code>, which allows it to be used in a greater variety 
  of product scenarios.</p>
