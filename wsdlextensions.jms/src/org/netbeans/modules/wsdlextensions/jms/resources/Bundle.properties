DESC_Element_jndienv="jndienv" defines the JNDI environment entries needed to lookup JMS connection factories using JNDI
DESC_Element_jndienventry="jndiEnvEntry" defines a JNDI environment map entry for the map used to create the initial JNDI context
DESC_Attribute_name=The name of the JNDI environment entry
DESC_Attribute_value=The value of the JNDI environment entry
DESC_Attribute_connectionURL=The connectivity information to connect to a JMS server. Format is protocol://server:port?key1=value1&key2=value2. For JNDI based connections, use "jndi://" as the value for connectionURL
DESC_Attribute_username=The username to use to connect to the JMS server
DESC_Attribute_password=The password to use to connect to the JMS server
DESC_Attribute_connectionFactoryName=When JNDI is used, this attribute specifies the JNDI name of the connection factory to look up
DESC_Attribute_initialContextFactory=When JNDI is used, this attribute specifies the initial context factory to use; see javax.naming.Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY
DESC_Attribute_providerURL=When JNDI is used, this attribute specifies the configuration information for the service provider to use; see javax.naming.Context.PROVIDER_URL
DESC_Attribute_securityPrincipal=When JNDI is used, this attribute specifies the dentity of the principal for authenticating the caller to the service; see javax.naming.Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL
DESC_Attribute_securityCredentials=When JNDI is used, this attribute specifies the the credentials of the principal for authenticating the caller to the service; see javax.naming.Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS
DESC_Element_operation="operation" indicates a JMS protocol based operation.
LBL_GRP_Common=Common
LBL_GRP_Consumer=Consumer
LBL_GRP_Provider=Provider
DESC_Element_options="usageOptions" defines additonal connection related configuration option(s)
DESC_Element_option="usageOption" defines a single additonal connection related usage option
DESC_Attribute_destination=Defines the destination where messages are sent or received
DESC_Attribute_destinationType=Defines the type (domain) of the destination where message are sent or received
DESC_Attribute_transaction=Defines the transaction type for the JMS protocol based operation
DESC_Attribute_deliveryMode=Sets the message delivery mode to use when sending a message
DESC_Attribute_timeToLive=Time in milliseconds from its dispatch time that a produced message, from the message producer, should be retained by the message system
DESC_Attribute_priority=Sets the message priority level for messages sent; must be a value between 0 and 9; 0 is lowest, 9 is highest; default is 4
DESC_Attribute_disableMessageID=Enables or disables the auto-generation of message IDs on messages sent. This only serves as a hint to the JMS provider; check with the provider you are using to see if this is supported.
DESC_Attribute_disableMessageTimeStamp=Enables or disables the auto-generation of timestamps on messages sent. This only serves as a hint to the JMS provider; check with the provider you are using to see if this is supported.
DESC_Attribute_timeout=Sets the timeout waiting for a reply message; applies only if the operation is an In-Out message exchange pattern
DESC_Attribute_clientID=Sets the unique client ID; if using a durable subscriber and this is not set then the durableName will be used as the clientID
DESC_Attribute_messageSelector=Defines the JMS message selector to use for message consumption
DESC_Attribute_subscriptionDurability=If true, and the destination is a Topic, creates a durable subscriber on that Topic
DESC_Attribute_subscriptionName=Sets the durable subscription name; used only if using a durable subscriber (destination is a Topic and subscriptionDurability is set to true)
DESC_Attribute_maxConcurrentConsumers=This element specifies the maximum number of concurrent receivers that can process messages.
DESC_Attribute_concurrencyMode=Specifies the concurrency mode. Note that there is no concurrent processing for Topics in sync mode.
DESC_Attribute_batchSize=If defined with a positive integer, this attribute specifies that the messages received will be batched. The actual number of messages in the batch could be less than or equal to the specified size.
DESC_Attribute_redeliveryHandling=If defined, this attribute specifies what actions to take in the event that an error occurred in processing the JMS message received from the JMS destination (for example, putting the "poisoned" message in a dead letter queue). \n\
   format := entry[; entry]*\n\
   entry := idx ":" action\n\
   idx := number (denotes the n-th time a msg was seen)\n\
   action := number (denotes delay in ms) | "delete" | "move"(args)\n\
   move := "queue"|"topic" | "same" ":" destname\n\
   destname :=  any string, may include "$" which will be replaced with the original destination name.\n\
\n\
Example:\n\
    5:1000; 10:5000; 50:move(queue:mydlq)\n\
\n\
This causes no delay up to the 5th delivery; a 1000 ms delay is invoked when the message is seen the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th time. A 5 second delay is invoked when the msg is invoked the 10th, 11th, ..., 49th time. When the msg is seen the 50th time the msg is moved to a queue with the name "mydlq".
DESC_Attribute_validateMessageSelector=If messageSelector is used, this enables or disables the validation of the message selector syntax during deployment. Default is true if not specified.

DESC_Attribute_type=The type of the JMS property
DESC_Element_mapmessage="mapmessageparts" defines the JMS MapMessage entry(ies) to the WSDL Message part(s) mapping
DESC_Element_mappart="mappart" defines a single JMS MapMessage entry to a WSDL Message part mapping
