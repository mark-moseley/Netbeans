/** Handles syntax coloring for JSP 1.1. This involves handling custom tags.
 * This class relies on an external source of data, which provides information
 * about tag libraries. The information necessary is:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Prefixes of tag libraries imported by the page (and its included pages !)</li>
 *   <li>For individual tags inside the tag libraries, it's <code>bodyContent</code> property</li>
 * </ul>
 * This class is able to deal with cases when this information is incomplete, 
 * i.e. if the information for individual tags is missing (for example in the case when the
 * .tld descriptor of the library was not found). In such a case the tags for which the information
 * is missing are treated as if they had bodycontent set to JSP.
 *
 * // PENDING - handle TAG_DEPENDENT tags correctly, change JspMultiSyntax and JspTagSyntax accordingly
 *
 * @author  petr.jiricka@netbeans.com
 * @deprecated Use {@link JspLexer} instead.
