INFO FOR PEOPLE ADDING CHANGES:

Check the DTD (apichanges.dtd) for details on the syntax. You do not
need to regenerate the HTML, as this is part of Javadoc generation; just
change the XML. Rough syntax of a change (several parts optional):

<change>
    <api name="compiler"/>
    <summary>Some brief description here, can use <b>XHTML</b></summary>
    <version major="1" minor="99"/>
    <date day="13" month="6" year="2001"/>
    <author login="jrhacker"/>
    <compatibility addition="yes"/>
    <description>
        The main description of the change here.
        Again can use full <b>XHTML</b> as needed.
    </description>
    <class package="org.openide.compiler" name="DoWhatIWantCompiler"/>
    <issue number="14309"/>
</change>

Also permitted elements: <package>, <branch>. <version> is API spec
version, recommended for all new changes. <compatibility> should say
if things were added/modified/deprecated/etc. and give all information
related to upgrading old code. List affected top-level classes and
link to issue numbers if applicable. See the DTD for more details.

Changes need not be in any particular order, they are sorted in various
ways by the stylesheet anyway.

Dates are assumed to mean "on the trunk". If you *also* make the same
change on a stabilization branch, use the <branch> tag to indicate this
and explain why the change was made on a branch in the <description>.

Please only change this file on the trunk! Rather: you can change it
on branches if you want, but these changes will be ignored; only the
trunk version of this file is important.

Deprecations do not count as incompatible, assuming that code using the
deprecated calls continues to see their documented behavior. But do
specify deprecation="yes" in <compatibility>.

This file is not a replacement for Javadoc: it is intended to list changes,
not describe the complete current behavior, for which ordinary documentation
is the proper place.

            <description>
            <p>
                Two methods were added for the benefit of keymaps and macros
                storage implementations. The added methods are - 
                <code>StorageSupport.stringToKeyStrokes</code> and
                <code>StorageSupport.keyStrokesToString</code>.

            <description>
            <p>
                The classes related to the code templates storage were moved to
                the editor/codetemplates module, which is no using the new SPI to
                plugin its own storage files reader/writer.

            <summary>#90403 - phase 1</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="10"/>
            <date day="21" month="3" year="2007"/>
            <author login="vstejskal"/>
            <compatibility addition="yes" binary="compatible" source="compatible" semantic="compatible" deprecation="yes" deletion="no" modification="no" />
            <description>
            <p>
                The phase 1 of the editor settings enhancements, please see
                <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=90403">issue 90403</a>
                for details. Briefly, the changes involve introducing a special
                folder for each setting type, profiles are always stored in their
                own folder, modules are allowed to register multiple settings files,
                platform specific settings, the use of 'text/base' for all-editors
                settings has been deprecated in favor of the hierarchy root (ie. 'Editors' folder), etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The changes are documented in the Architecture Description document
                and marked with the module version.

            <summary>Adding EditorSettings.getAllMimeTypes()</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="9"/>
            <date day="5" month="2" year="2007"/>

            <description>
            <p>
                Adding <code>EditorSettings.getAllMimeTypes()</code> method, which
                lists all top-level mime types registered in <code>MimeLookup</code>.
            </p>

            <summary>Deprecating several methods and attributes in EditorSettings</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="8"/>
            <date day="30" month="12" year="2006"/>
            <author login="vstejskal"/>
            <compatibility addition="no" binary="compatible" source="compatible" semantic="compatible" deprecation="yes" deletion="no" modification="no" />
            <description>
            <p>
                The <code>getDefaultFontColors</code>, <code>getDefaultFontColorDefaults</code>
                and <code>setDefaultFontColors</code> methods in the <code>EditorSettings</code>
                classe were deprecated in favor of using <code>EditorSettings.getFontColorSettings(String[])</code>
                with an empty mime path, which is the standard way of getting defaults
                for all document types.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>PROP_DEFAULT_FONT_COLORS</code> and <code>PROP_EDITOR_FONT_COLORS</code>
                should have never been made public. They are only used internally.
            </p>

        <change>
            <summary>OpenIDE-Module-Provides: org.netbeans.api.editor.settings.implementation</summary>
            <version major="1" minor="7"/>
            <date day="13" month="11" year="2006"/>

            <compatibility addition="yes" binary="compatible" source="compatible" semantic="compatible" deprecation="no" deletion="no" modification="no" />
            <description>
            <p>
                The module is now 'eager' and it provides the <code>org.netbeans.api.editor.settings.implementation</code>
                token required by the <code>editor/settings</code> module. Also
                the API was properly marked as for-friends-only.
