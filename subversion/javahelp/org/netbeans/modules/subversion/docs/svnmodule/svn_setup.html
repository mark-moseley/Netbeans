        <h2>Setting Up Subversion</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>Before you can take advantage of the IDE's Subversion support, you need 
            to have Subversion client software installed on your system. The IDE 
            supports Subversion client versions 1.3.x and 1.4.0. The IDE's Subversion support 
        works by interacting with the Subversion client to carry out the commands.</p>
        <p>You can download Subversion as either sources or as a binary from the 
        following link:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><object CLASSID="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                    <param name="content" value="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">
                    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html</u></html>">
                    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
            </object></li>
        </ul>
                <p>
            Though the Subversion site does not guarantee the quality of the 
            binary downloads, you might find them easier to work with. For example, 
            the executable binary for Microsoft Windows systems sets up the environment 
        variable to make your system and the IDE recognize the Subversion installation. 
        If you do not use an installer, follow the Subversion installation instructions closely 
        to make sure that you set up everything correctly on your system.</p>
        <p>After the Subversion client is set up, you can run Subversion commands from 
        the IDE's Subversion menu.
        <!--need only to 
        check out the files located in a remote repository to a local working directory on your system. 
        In the process of checking out, the IDE automatically registers the working directory where
        your local copies of version-controlled files and their 
        status information will be stored. </p>-->
        <p>If you have already checked out files from a Subversion repository (using Subversion 1.3 or 1.4), the IDE automatically 
            recognizes the files as versioned files if those files are part of an open IDE 
            project or if they are added to the Favorites window. You can call Subversion commands on 
            such files from the Subversion menu or by right-clicking a file or folder and choosing 
        from the Subversion submenu.</p>
        <p>If you have not checked out any files from a Subversion repository, you can 
            check them out by choosing Subversion &gt; Checkout. 
            See <a href="svn_checkout.html">Checking Out Files from a
        Subversion Repository</a> for more information.</p>
