        <h2>Reverting Modifications</h2>
        
        <p>Occasionally it may be desirable or necessary to revert changes made to files in your
            local working copy. You may need to either revert changes made locally, or retrieve
            revisions from the repository, and undo any changes to files caused by these revisions.
            The IDE enables you to do this using the Revert Modifications command.</p>
            
        <h4>To revert modifications:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Select the versioned file for which you want to revert changes (e.g. from the Projects,
                Files, Favorites or <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a> window) and 
                choose Revert Modifications (or Subversion &gt; Revert Modifications). The 
                <a href="csh/svn_revert_mod_dialog.html">Revert Modifications dialog box</a> opens, 
                enabling you to specify criteria.</li>
            <li>In the Revert Modifications dialog box, select one of three options:
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revert Local Changes.</strong> Reverts any changes made in your local 
                        working copy to the previously committed or updated version.</li>
                    <li><strong>Revert Modifications from Single Commit.</strong> Reverts the local 
                        working copy to the repository revision made prior to the previous commit. (Specify 
                        a revision number in the Revision text field.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Revert Modifications from Previous Commits.</strong> Reverts the local 
                        working copy to a specified revision from the repository. (Specify starting and 
                        ending revision numbers in the corresponding text fields.)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <ul class="note">
                    <li>You can delete any files or folders which were created in your local working 
                        copy since the point which you are reverting to by selecting the <strong>Remove 
                        Newly Added Files and Folders</strong> option.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Click Revert. The IDE reverts any changes in the local file to a state that corresponds with
                the repository version, according to the specified parameters.</li>
        </ul>
