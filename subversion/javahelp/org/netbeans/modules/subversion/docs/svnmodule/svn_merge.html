        <p>The Merge command is useful for porting changes from a specific repository 
            revision to your local working copy of a file or folder. You can also port 
            the changes made within a given range of revisions to your local working copy.</p>
        
        <h4>To port changes from a revision or range of revisions to your local working copy:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, or Favorites window, right-click the files or 
                folders on which you want to perform the merge operation and choose 
                Subversion &gt; Merge Changes.</li>
            <li>In the dialog that appears, fill in the following fields:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Merge From.</strong> Select one of the following types of merge:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>One Repository Folder.</strong> Port changes from one repository folder.</li>
                            <li><strong>Two Repository Folders.</strong> Port changes from two repository folders.</li>
                            <li><strong>One Repository Folder Since Its Origin.</strong> Port changes that have 
                                occurred between the time of the folder's creation and the revision number that 
                                you specify in the Ending Revision Field.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li><strong>Repository Folder.</strong> The folder from which you want to port changes. (If you 
                        select Two Repository Folders in the Merge From field, this field is replaced by 
                        First Repository Folder and Second Repository Folder fields.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Starting Revision.</strong> If merging from a single revision, enter the revision 
                        number. If merging changes that occurred within a range of revisions, enter the starting 
                        point of that range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ending Revision.</strong> If merging changes that occurred within a range of revisions, 
                        enter the ending point of that range.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Click Merge. The IDE incorporates any differences found in the selected revision 
                to the local copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's status is 
                updated to Merge Conflict to indicate this.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>After merging file changes to your local working directory, you must still commit changes 
                using the Commit command in order for them to be added to the repository.</li>
        </ul>
