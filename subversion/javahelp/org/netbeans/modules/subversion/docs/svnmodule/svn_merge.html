        </h2>

        <p>The Merge command is useful for porting changes from a specific 
        repository revision to your local working copy of a
        file or folder. You can also port the changes made within a given range 
        of revisions to your local working copy.</p>
        <p><b>To port changes from a revision or range of revisions to your local working copy:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, Favorites, or Subversion window,
            right-click the files or folders on which you want to perform the 
            merge operation and choose Subversion &gt; Merge Changes. </li>
            <li>In the dialog that appears, fill in the following fields:
                <ul>
                <li><b>Merge From.</b> Select one of the following types of merge:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>One Repository Folder.</b> Port changes from one repository folder.</li>
                    <li><b>Two Repository Folders.</b> Port changes from two repository folders.</li>
                    <li><b>One Repository Folder Since Its Origin.</b> Port changes 
                    that have occurred between the time of the folder's creation and 
                    the revision number that you specify in the Ending Revision Field.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Repository Folder.</b> The folder from which you want to port changes. (If you 
                select Two Repository Folders in the Merge From field, this field is replaced by 
                First Repository Folder and Second Repository Folder fields.)</li>
                <li><b>Starting Revision.</b> If merging from a single revision, enter the revision 
                number. If merging changes that occurred within a range of revisions, enter 
                the starting point of that range.</li>
                <li><b>Ending Revision.</b> If merging changes that occurred within a range of revisions, enter 
                the ending point of that range.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Click Merge.
                <p>The IDE incorporates any differences found in the selected revision 
                to the local copy of the file. If merge conflicts occur, the file's
                status is updated to Merge Conflict to indicate this.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="note">
            <li>After merging file changes to your local working
            directory, you must still commit the changes using the Commit command
            in order for them to added to the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information about merging files with Subversion consult your Subversion
        documentation.
