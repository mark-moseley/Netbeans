        <h2>Subversion: Subversion Property Editor</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
       
        <p>The Subversion Property Editor serves as an interface allowing you to apply arbitrary 
            metadata to files or directories. Metadata is maintained in the form of Subversion 
            properties, which are name/value pairs associated with items located in your working 
            copy.</p>
           
        <p>The Property Editor is accessed either by choosing Subversion &gt; Svn Properties from the
            right-click menu of a versioned file (e.g. in the Projects, Files, or Favorites 
            window), or by selecting a versioned file, then choosing Versioning &gt; Svn Properties 
            from the IDE's main menu.</p>
        
        <p>With the Property Editor, you can add, modify and delete properties associated with a 
            given file or directory. In the editor, specify the following:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Property Name.</strong> Specify a name for the property you want to add to
                the selected file or directory. You can enter your own name, otherwise select a
                Subversion reserved property name from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li><strong>Property Value.</strong> Specify the value(s) you want to associate to the
                property name.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>To attach an existing file as a property, click Load to open a dialog allowing 
                you to navigate to that file. When you select a file in this manner, the file 
                will be automatically loaded into the Property Value text area.</li>
        </ul>        
        
        <h4>To add a property to a selected file or directory:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Click Add. The IDE performs the action of attaching the specified property to the 
                selected file or directory. The name/value property pair displays in the Subversion 
                Properties table displayed at the bottom of the editor.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you are performing changes on a directory and want to add the specified property to
                all files and directories included in that directory, select the <strong>Recursively</strong>
                option located next to the Add button.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Refresh</strong> button is designed to be used only in circumstances where 
                property files can be modified externally.</li>
            <li>When working with files or directories that contain many properties, it can be useful to 
                sort properties alphabetically by name or value. To do so, click on the Name or Value
                heading in the Subversion Properties table displayed at the bottom of the editor.</li>
        </ul>        
                
        <h4>To remove a property from a selected file or directory:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Click Remove. The IDE performs the action of deleting the specified property to the 
                selected file or directory. The name/value property pair is removed from the Subversion 
                Properties table displayed at the bottom of the editor.</li>
        </ul>
