        <h2>Subversion: Commit Dialog Box</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>The Subversion Commit dialog box enables you to commit local changes in 
            version-controlled files to the repository. If you have an <a href="#">issue
            tracker</a> set up with your repository, the commit dialog box lets you
            associate your commit action with an existing issue.</p>
            
        <p>You access this dialog box by right-clicking a version-controlled file or
            folder that contain local changes and choosing Subversion &gt; Commit. You
            can also access this dialog box by selecting the commit button
            (<img src="../images/commit.png" alt="commit button">) in the 
            <a href="../svn_diff.html">Diff Viewer</a> or the 
            <a href="svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning window</a>.</p>
                
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Commit Message</strong>: Type in a message describing your commit action.

                <ul class="note">
                    <li>When entering a commit message, you can view previous messages by clicking 
                        the Recent Messages button (<img src="../images/recent_msgs.png" 
                        alt="recent messages button">) located in the upper right corner of the 
                        dialog. A dialog displays, listing recent commit messages.</li>
               <!-- <li>If you know you will be repeatedly making commits for the same purpose, 
                        you can set text to be included as a template for commit messages. Click 
                        the Load Template icon (<img src="images/load_template.png"
                        alt="load templates icon">) in the upper right corner of the dialog to
                        load text from Template file directly into the Commit Message text area.</li> -->                
                </ul></li>

            <li><strong>Files to Commit</strong>: View files that will be included in the commit action.
                
                <p>When you click on a field in the Commit Action column, you can specify additional
                    actions by choosing from the drop-down list:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exclude from Commit</strong>: Exclude the selected file from the
                        commit action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add as Text</strong>: Set the MIME type for the file as textual data.
                        (For new files only. New files are displayed in green text.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Add as Binary</strong>: Set the MIME type for the file as binary
                        data. (For new files only. New files are displayed in green text.)</li>
                </ul></li>

            <li><strong>Update Issue</strong>: Update an issue by associating your commit action
                with an existing issue in your repository's issue tracker.

                        uses, by selecting an issue tracker from the drop-down list. The drop-down
                        provides you with a list of all issue trackers registered with the IDE. If
                        your repository's issue tracker is not registered, click the <strong>New</strong>
                        button to register it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Issue</strong>: Specify the issue ID. You can do this by typing in
                        the ID, or part of the description.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can also specify the following options:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resolve as FIXED</strong>: When selected, the status of the issue is marked as Resolved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Commit Message from Above</strong>: When selected, the commit message
                        is added to the issue.</li>

                        to include the revision information such as the author, date, etc.
                        You can click Change Format to modify the format of the revision information
                        that is added to the issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Issue Information to Commit Message</strong>: When selected, the issue ID and summary
                        are added to the commit message.
