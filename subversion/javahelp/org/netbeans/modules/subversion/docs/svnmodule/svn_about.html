        <h2>About the IDE's Subversion Support</h2>
        
        <p>Like CVS, Subversion is a type of version control system 
            that aids developer groups working with
            shared source files in common repositories by managing file revision
        history information. </p>
        
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to
            manage changes to version-controlled files as you work. In the IDE, you
            can call Subversion commands on both files and directories
        in the Projects, Files, Versioning, and Favorites window. </p>
        <p>Subversion is an improvement upon CVS in many ways, 
            such as the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Allows you to rename documents in your repository and keep the whole 
                history of the document's revisions.</li>
                <li>Treats commits as whole entities. If you attempt to commit changes to 
                several files and the commit fails, no files are changed in the repository.</li>
                <li>Has a generally more robust design.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support is similar in style to the IDE's CVS support. 
            If you are used to using CVS in the IDE, you only need to make minor adjustments 
        to start working with the IDE's Subversion support.</p>
        <p>One crucial difference between the IDE's CVS support and the IDE's 
            Subversion support is that the IDE does not have the Subversion client 
            commands built in. You need to download and install the Subversion client 
            separately. The IDE then accesses this client when you call Subversion 
        commands from the IDE.</p>
        <p>You can download Subversion as either sources or as a binary from the 
        following link:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><object CLASSID="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
                    <param name="content" value="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">
                    <param name="text" value="<html><u>the Subversion Packages page</u></html>">
                    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
                    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
            </object></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Though the Subversion site does not guarantee the quality of the 
            binary downloads, you might find them easier to work with. For example, 
            the executable binary for Microsoft Windows systems sets up the environment 
        variable to make your system and the IDE recognize the Subversion installation.</p>

            overview of the typical workflow when using Subversion in the IDE, see
