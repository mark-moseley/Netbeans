        <h2>Working with Version Histories</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Searching the histories of files can be helpful when you need to find specific 
            commits, for example when backporting bugs. The IDE's Search Histories window 
            enables you to view a summary of a file's evolution over time by revision number.</p>
        
        <p>You can view file histories in the IDE's Search History window. To do so, select
            a versioned file (e.g. from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window) and choose 
            either Subversion &gt; Search History from the right-click menu or Versioning &gt;
            Search History from the main menu. Alternately, in the
            <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a> window you can choose Search 
            History from a file's right-click menu.</p>
        
        <h3>Searching for Specific Revisions</h3>
        
        <p>Using the Search History window, you can search a file or folder's history for
            versions based on several criteria. These are:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Message</strong>. The description submitted with the commit.</li>
            <li><strong>Username</strong>. The author of the commit.</li>
            <li><strong>From</strong>. The tag, revision number, or date from which the 
                commit was made.</li>
            <li><strong>To</strong>. The tag, revision number, or date before which the
                commit was made.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To search for a specific revision:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the file or folder for which you want to find a specific revision.</li>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Search History from the main menu. Alternately, 
                you can choose Subversion &gt; Search History from the selected file's right-click 
                menu. The IDE displays the file's revision history in the Search History window.</li>
            <li>Enter search criteria information in the Message, Username, From, and To fields. 
                You can also use the Browse buttons to designate any tag, branch, revision, or 
                date you want to limit your search to.</li>
            <li>Click Search. The IDE displays the file's revision history in the Search
                History window.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Comparing Revisions in the Search History Window</h3>
        
        <p>You can compare a file with previous versions from within the Search Histories 
            window using the Diff (<img src="images/diff.png">) button.</p>
            
        <p><strong>To view revision differences in the Search History window:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Click the Diff button in the toolbar.</li>
            <li>Select the revision against which you want to compare your local working copy.
                The IDE displays a diff of the file's revisions within the Search History window. 
                Note that you can navigate between the differences using the Previous Difference 
                (<img src="images/diff-prev.png">) and Next Difference (<img src="images/diff-next.png">) 
                buttons.</li>
        </ol>
