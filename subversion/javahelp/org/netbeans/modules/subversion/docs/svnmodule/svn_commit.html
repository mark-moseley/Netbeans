        <h2>Committing Local Changes to a Subversion Repository</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been edited, 
            you can then place your changes into the repository using the
            Commit command (from the Versioning &gt; Subversion menu, or from a
            version-controlled file's right-click menu).</p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Project directories must be located within a local working directory 
                that is registered with the IDE in order to call Subversion commands
                on them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To commit changes in local files to a remote repository:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select a version-controlled file or folder and choose Subversion &gt; 
                Commit from the right-click menu. The Commit Dialog opens, listing all
                files that contain local changes. If the files you want to commit do 
                not already exist in the repository, the commit action will add them.</li>
            <li>Enter a commit message in the Commit Message text area, indicating the 
                purpose of the commit.</li>
            <li>Click Commit. 
                <br>The IDE executes the commit and sends your local changes to the 
                repository.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>It is recommended that you perform an update (Subversion &gt; Update) on 
                any files prior to committing them to the repository. By doing so, you will 
                be able to identify and handle any conflicts arising from repository changes 
                prior to performing your commit.</li>
            <li>When working in the Commit dialog, you can exclude individual files from a commit.
                To do so, click on the Commit Action column for the specific file and choose 
                Exclude from Commit. The file name responds by displaying in strike-through text.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ignoring Files</h3>
        
        <p>If your local working directory includes files or directories that you do not 
            want to place under version control, you can set the IDE to ignore them 
            permanantly using the Ignore command.</p>
        
        <h4>To ignore local files in your working directory:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the files or directories you wish to ignore in the
                Versioning window, Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window.</li>
            <li>Right-click and choose Subversion &gt; Ignore. Note that the Ignore
                command is unavailable for files that already exist in the repository.
                <br>The IDE ignores the file or directory whenever Subversion commands are
                called on them or the directories within which they are stored.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>To change the status of ignored files so that they can be acted upon in 
                Subversion, select the specific file and choose Subversion &gt; Unignore.</li>
        </ul>
