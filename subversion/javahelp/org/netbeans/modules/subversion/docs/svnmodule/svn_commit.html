        <h2>Committing Local Changes to a Remote Repository (Subversion)</h2>
        
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
        <p>Once your working copies of version-controlled files have been edited, 
            you can then place changes into the repository using the Subversion 
            Commit action.</p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Subversion versioned files and folders must be recognized by the IDE
                as such in order to call Subversion actions on them. To do so, you 
                must first <a href="svn_checkout.html">checkout</a> sources from a 
                Subversion repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To commit changes in local files to a remote repository:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select a version-controlled file or folder (e.g. from the Projects,
                Files, or Favorites window) and choose Subversion &gt; Commit from 
                the right-click menu. The Commit Dialog opens, listing all files that 
                contain local changes. If the files you want to commit do not already 
                exist in the repository, the commit action will add them.</li>
            <li>Enter a commit message in the Commit Message text area, indicating the 
                purpose of the commit.
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the Recent Messages icon (<img src="images/recent_msgs.png" 
                        alt="recent messages icon">) in the upper right corner of the 
                        dialog to view recent commit messages.</li>
                 <!--   <li>Click the Load Template icon (<img src="images/load_template.png"
                        alt="load templates icon">) in the upper right corner of the 
                        dialog to load text from Template file directly into the Commit
                        Message text area.</li>   -->
                </ul></li>
                
            <li>Click Commit. The IDE executes the commit and sends your local changes to 
                the repository.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>It is recommended that you perform an update (Subversion &gt; Update) on 
                any files prior to committing them to the repository. By doing so, you will 
                be able to identify and handle any conflicts arising from repository changes 
                prior to performing your commit.</li>
            <li>When working in the Commit dialog, you can exclude individual files from a 
                commit. To do so, click on the Commit Action column for the specific file 
                and choose Exclude from Commit. The file name responds by displaying in 
                strike-through text.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Ignoring Files</h3>
        
        <p>If your local working directory includes files or directories that you do not 
            want to place under version control, you can set the IDE to ignore them 
            permanently using the Ignore command.</p>
            
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You cannot employ the Ignore command on files that already exist in the 
                repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To ignore local files in your working directory:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select the file or directory you wish to ignore from the
                Projects, Files, Favorites, or 
                <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a> window.</li>
            <li>Choose Ignore (or Subversion &gt; Ignore) from the right-click 
                menu of selected file or directory. The IDE ignores the file 
                or directory whenever Subversion commands are called on it or 
                on the directory within which it is stored.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>To change the status of ignored files so that they can be acted upon in 
                Subversion, select the specific file and choose Subversion &gt; Unignore.</li>
        </ul>
