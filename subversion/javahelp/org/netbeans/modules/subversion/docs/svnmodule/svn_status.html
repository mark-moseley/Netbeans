        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view and manage the evolution
        of changes in version-controlled files.</p>
        
        <h3>Viewing Revision Information<a name="viewing"></a></h3>
        
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view version status information in 
            many of the IDE's windows, including the Versioning, Projects, Files, and Favorites 
            windows. The Versioning window, however, represents the primary place within which 
            to manage version-controlled files by displaying a list of all of the new, modified, 
        removed, and out-of-date files in the currently selected project or directory.</p>
        
        <h4>To open the Versioning window, either:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Window &gt; Versioning &gt; Subversion from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Choose Show Changes from the right-click menu of a version-controlled file or 
                folder from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window.</li>
            <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Show Changes (Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Show 
                Changes) from the main menu.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The IDE's Subversion support provides file status information in the following
            ways:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Status Labels.</strong> Textual indication of file status in the Versioning, 
                Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. To display status labels, choose View 
                &gt; Show Versioning Labels from the main menu.</li>
            <li><strong>Status Color.</strong> Graphical indication of file status in the Versioning, 
                Projects, Files, and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Status Badges.</strong> Graphical indication of the status of files contained 
                within your project, folder, and package nodes. Displayed in the Projects, Files, 
                and Favorites windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Revision Annotations.</strong> Displays commit message, author, date, and 
                revision number information in the left margin of files open in the Source Editor. 
                To display annotations, select a versioned file in either the Projects, Files, and 
                Favorites window, then choose Show Annotations from its right-click menu. 
                Alternatively, choose Versioning, &gt; Show Annotations from the main menu.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The IDE displays version-controlled files using the following color coding and font styles:</p>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr valign="top">
                <th scope="col" align="left">Color Coding</th>

            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td align="center">
                    <p><img src="images/green_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
                </td>
                <td><strong>Green.</strong> Indicates that the file is 
                a new local file that does not yet exist in the repository.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td align="center">
                    <p><img src="images/blue_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>Blue.</strong> Indicates that the file has 
                    been modified locally.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td align="center">
                    <p><img src="images/red_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
                </td>
                <td><strong>Red.</strong> Indicates that the file contains conflicts.
                    You must use the Resolve Conflicts command (Subversion &gt; Resolve 
                Conflicts) for such files.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr valign="top">
                <td align="center">
                    <p><img src="images/grey_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
                </td>
                <td><strong>Grey.</strong> Indicates that the file is ignored by Subversion 
                and will not be included when calling versioning commands.</td>
            </tr>                    
            <tr valign="top">
                <td align="center">

                </td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>Strikethrough.</strong> Indicates that the file is excluded 
                        when calling the Commit command. All other Subversion commands, however, 
                        work as usual. Note that files displayed in the strikethrough style only 
                        appear in the Versioning window and Commit dialog. They will not appear 
                        in Diff panes, nor will their parent folders (or packages) display badges 
                        if they are modified.</p>

            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>Current Subversion file status is indicated by adding the following badges
        to project, package and directory icons:</p>
        
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
            <tr valign="top">

            <tr valign="top">
                <td align="center">

                </td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>Locally Modified Badge.</strong> A blue badge on a
                        folder or package node marks folders or packages that contain locally
                        modified or new files. In the case of packages, this badge applies only
                        to the package itself and not its subpackages. For folders, the badge
                        indicates local modifications in that folder or any of its subfolders.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>

                </td>
                <td>
                    <p><strong>Conflict Badge.</strong> A red badge on a folder or package 
                        node marks folders or packages that contain files for which the repository 
                        copy of the file contains changes which conflict with the local version. 
                        In case of packages, this badge applies only to the package itself and not 
                        its subpackages. For folders, the badge indicates local modifications in 
                        that folder or any of its subfolders.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>

                and displayed in the strikethrough style will not display badges if they
