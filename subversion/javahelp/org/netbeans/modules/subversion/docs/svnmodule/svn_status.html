<h2>Viewing File Status Information</h2>

<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

<p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view and manage the evolution
of changes in version-controlled files.</p>

<h3>Viewing Revision Information<a name="viewing"></a></h3>

<p>The IDE's Subversion support enables you to view version status information in 
    many of the IDE's windows, including the Versioning, Projects, Files, and Favorites 
    windows. The Versioning window, however, represents the primary place within which 
    to manage version-controlled files by displaying a list of all of the new, modified, 
removed, and out-of-date files in the currently selected project or directory.</p>

<p>To open the Versioning window, either:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Choose Window &gt; Versioning (Ctrl+8) from the main menu</li>
    <li>Choose Show Changes from the right-click menu of a version-controlled folder 
    from the Projects, Files, or Favorites window</li>
    <li>Choose Versioning &gt; Show Changes (Versioning &gt; Subversion &gt; Show 
    Changes) from the main menu</li>
</ul>

<p>The IDE's Subversion support provides file status information in the following
ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Status Labels.</b> Textual indication of file status in the Versioning, 
        Projects, Files, and Favorites windows. To display status labels, choose View 
    &gt; Show Versioning Labels from the main menu.</li>
    <li><b>Status Color.</b> Graphical indication of file status in the Versioning, 
    Projects, Files, and Favorites windows.</li>
    <li><b>Status Badges.</b> Graphical indication of the status of files contained 
        within your project, folder, and package nodes. Displayed in the Projects, Files, 
    and Favorites windows.</li>
    <li><b>Revision Annotations.</b> Displays commit message, author, date, and 
        revision number information in the left margin of files open in the Source Editor. 
        To display annotations, select a versioned file in either the Projects, Files, and 
        Favorites window, then choose Show Annotations from its right-click menu. 
    Alternatively, choose Versioning, &gt; Show Annotations from the main menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>The IDE displays version-controlled files using the following color coding and font styles:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr valign="top">
        <th scope="col" align="left">Color Coding</th>
        <th scope="col" align="center">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="center">
            <p><img src="images/green_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
        </td>
        <td><strong>Green.</strong> Indicates that the file is 
        a new local file that does not yet exist in the repository.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="center">
            <p><img src="images/blue_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p><strong>Blue.</strong> Indicates that the file has 
            been modified locally.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="center">
            <p><img src="images/red_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
        </td>
        <td><strong>Red.</strong> Indicates that the file contains conflicts.
            You must use the Resolve Conflicts command (Subversion &gt; Resolve 
        Conflicts) for such files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="center">
            <p><img src="images/grey_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
        </td>
        <td><strong>Grey.</strong> Indicates that the file is ignored by Subversion 
        and will not be included when calling versioning commands.</td>
    </tr>                    
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="center">
            <p><img src="images/strikethrough_status.png" alt="Note"></p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p><strong>Strikethrough.</strong> Indicates that the file is excluded 
                when calling the Commit command. All other Subversion commands, however, 
                work as usual. Note that files displayed in the strikethrough style only 
                appear in the Versioning window and Commit dialog. They will not appear 
                in Diff panes, nor will their parent folders (or packages) display badges 
            if they are modified.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Current Subversion file status is indicated by adding the following badges
to project, package and directory icons:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr valign="top">
        <th scope="col" align="left">Badge</th>
        <th scope="col" align="center">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="center">
            <p><img src="images/blue_badge.png" alt="Note"></p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p><strong>Locally Modified Badge.</strong> A blue badge on a
                folder or package node marks folders or packages that contain locally
                modified or new files. In the case of packages, this badge applies only
                to the package itself and not its subpackages. For folders, the badge
            indicates local modifications in that folder or any of its subfolders.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
        <td align="center">
            <p><img src="images/red_badge.png" alt="Note"></p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p><strong>Conflict Badge.</strong> A red badge on a folder or package 
                node marks folders or packages that contain files for which the repository 
                copy of the file contains changes which conflict with the local version. 
                In case of packages, this badge applies only to the package itself and not 
                its subpackages. For folders, the badge indicates local modifications in 
            that folder or any of its subfolders.</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<ul class="note">
    <li>Note that the parent folders (or packages) of files excluded from commits
        and displayed in the strikethrough style will not display badges if they 
    are modified.</li>
