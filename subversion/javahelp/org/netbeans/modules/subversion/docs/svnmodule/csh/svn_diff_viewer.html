	<h2>Subversion: Diff Viewer</h2>
        
	<p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        
	<p>The IDE's graphical Diff Viewer enables you to <a href="../svn_diff.html">compare 
            revisions</a> of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the differences 
            between the files being compared.</p>
            
	<p>You access the Diff Viewer by right-clicking a versioned file or folder (e.g. from the 
            Projects, Files or Favorites window) and choosing Subversion &gt; Diff. The Diff Viewer can
            also be accessed by selecting the Diff view for a revision in the 
            <a href="svn_history_viewer.html">History Viewer</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The icons in the Diff Viewer toolbar enable you to perform the following functions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Change viewing criteria</strong>. You can choose whether to view files 
                containing changes from the local working copy, the repository, as well as both 
                simultaneously.
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local</strong> (<img src="../images/locally_mod.png" alt="locally modified icon">). 
                        Displays locally modified files only.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remote</strong> (<img src="../images/remotely_mod.png" alt="remotely modified icon">). 
                        Displays remotely modified files only.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local and Remote</strong> (<img src="../images/both_mod.png" alt="locally and remotely modified icon">). 
                        Displays both locally and remotely modified files.</li>            
                </ul></li>
                
            <li><strong>Navigate among differences found in the compared files</strong>. You can
                view differences as they appear from top to bottom.
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Previous</strong> (<img src="../images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button">). 
                        Goes to previous difference displayed in the diff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next</strong> (<img src="../images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">). 
                        Goes to next difference displayed in the diff.</li>
                </ul></li>
        
            <li><strong>Perform refresh/update on the diff</strong>. You can refresh the status of the diff in 
                the event that changes to your local working directory have been made externally. 
                You can also update the status of repository versions of files shown in the diff.
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Refresh</strong> (<img src="../images/refresh.png" alt="refresh diff button">). 
                        Refreshes the diff in the event that you have made changes to your local 
                        working directory externally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Update</strong> (<img src="../images/update.png" alt="update button">). 
                        Updates the repository version of the file displayed in the diff.</li>
                </ul></li>
                
            <li><strong>Commit changes</strong>. You can commit changes in your local version to the repository.
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commit</strong> (<img src="../images/commit.png" alt="commit button">). 
                        Commits any changes you have made in the local version to the repository.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you choose to open the Diff Viewer on a selected item, all files contained in the 
            item display in the table located above the graphical viewer (In the event that you 
            select a single file, only that file is displayed). The table lists all modified files 
            and organizes information based on the following column headings:</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File</strong>. The name of the file.</li>
            <li><strong>Status</strong>. The status of the file (i.e. modified locally or remotely).</li>            
            <li><strong>Location</strong>. The relative path of the file found in the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Upon selecting a file from the table, the Diff Viewer displays differences between two 
            versions of a file, select the table row corresponding to the desired file.</p>
        
        <p>The Diff Viewer highlights changes in the files using the following color encoding.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue</strong> (<span style="background-color:#b8cfe5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>).
                Indicates lines that have been changed since the earlier revision</li>
            <li><strong>Green</strong> (<span style="background-color:#b4ffb4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>).
                Indicates lines that have been added since the earlier revision</li>
            <li><strong>Red</strong> (<span style="background-color:#ffa0b4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>).
                Indicates lines that have been removed since the earlier revision</li>
        </ul>
             
        
        <p>The following icons enable you to make changes directly within the Diff Viewer</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Replace</strong> (<img src="../images/insert.png" alt="replace icon">). 
                Inserts the highlighted text from the previous revision into the current 
                revision</li>
            <li><strong>Move All</strong> (<img src="../images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon">). 
                Reverts the file's current version to the state of the selected previous 
                version.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove</strong> (<img src="../images/remove.png" alt="remove icon">). 
                Removes the highlighted text from the current version so that it mirrors the 
                previous version.</li>
        </ul>
