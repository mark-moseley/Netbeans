        <h2>Versioning: Open Projects Dialog Box</h2>

        <p>The Open Project dialog box enables you to open a project in the IDE when you
            have completed a checkout (CVS, Subversion) or clone (Mercurial).</p>

        <p>This dialog box appears when the versioning operation you are currently running
            successfully completes, and the sources obtained from the operation contain
            more than one NetBeans project.</p>

        <p>The dialog box displays any NetBeans projects that were identified during the
            operation. Click on a project to select it, or Ctrl-click to select multiple
            projects simultaneously.</p>

        <p>When you click OK, the selected project(s) open in the IDE and can be managed from
            the Projects window (Ctrl-1).</p>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Select the <strong>Open Required</strong> option to ensure that any sub-projects
                or dependencies (e.g., libraries or module dependencies) that the selected
                project(s) require are also opened.</li>
        </ul>
