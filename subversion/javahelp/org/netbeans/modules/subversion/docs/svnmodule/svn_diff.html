        <p>The Diff command compares different revisions of a file and displays the
            differences found graphically.</p>
            
        <h3>Comparing File Revisions Graphically</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE's graphical <a href="csh/svn_diff_viewer.html">Diff Viewer</a> 
            enables you to compare different versions of a file side by side using color 
            coding to emphasize the differences between the files being compared.</p>
            
        <p>The previous (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="last difference button">) 
            and next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">) 
            difference buttons in the toolbar enable you to navigate among the differences 
            in the file. You can also refresh the status and update files from within
            the Diff Viewer using the Refresh Diff (<img src="images/refresh.png"
            alt="Last difference button">) and Update (<img src="images/update.png" 
            alt="Last difference button">) buttons. When you are finished comparing 
            the files, you can commit your changes using the Diff Viewer's Commit button
            (<img src="images/commit.png" alt="Last difference button">).</p>

        <h4>To generate a graphical diff comparing a repository revision to your working copy:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Right-click a versioned file node in the Projects, Files, or 
                <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a>
                window and choose Diff (or Subversion &gt; Diff). The IDE displays the 
                results in the Diff Viewer in a new tab of the main window.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>If you want to perform a diff on all files contained in a folder, select
                a folder and choose Subversion &gt; Diff from the right-click menu. All 
                files that contain differences between your local version and the
                repository version will be listed in the upper pane of the Diff Viewer.
                You can then view individual diffs on files by clicking a file from 
                the list.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To make changes to a file while comparing it in the Diff Viewer:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate through differences between the two versions using the previous
                difference (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button">) 
                and next difference (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="next difference button">) 
                arrow icons.</li>
            <li>Click any of the <a href="#icons">displayed icons</a> to perform immediate changes 
                to your local copy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Your local copy appears in the right pane of the Diff Viewer. You can also make 
                changes to your local copy by typing directly into it in the Diff Viewer.</li>
            <li>Any changes made in the Diff Viewer are automatically saved as they occur.</li>
        </ul>
        <a name="icons"></a>
        <p>The following icons enable you to make changes directly within the Diff Viewer</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Replace</strong> (<img src="images/insert.png" alt="replace icon">). 
                Inserts the highlighted text from the previous revision into the current 
                revision</li>
            <li><strong>Move All</strong> (<img src="images/arrow.png" alt="move all icon">). 
                Reverts the file's current version to the state of the selected previous 
                version.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove</strong> (<img src="images/remove.png" alt="remove icon">). 
                Removes the highlighted text from the current version so that it mirrors the 
                previous version.</li>
        </ul>
