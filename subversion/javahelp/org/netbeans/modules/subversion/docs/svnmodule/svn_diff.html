        <p>You can compare two file revisions side-by-side by performing a diff. 
            The diff command allows you to compare two different revisions through
            a graphical Diff Viewer.</p>
            
        <h3>Comparing File Revisions Graphically</h3>
        
        <p>The IDE's Diff Viewer enables you to compare different
            versions of a file side by side using color coding to emphasize the
            differences between the files being compared.</p>
            
        <p>The Previous (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="previous difference button" 
            height="16" width="16">) and Next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" 
            alt="next difference button" height="16" width="16">) difference
            buttons in the toolbar enable you to navigate among differences found in
            the file. You can also refresh the status and update files from within
            the Diff Viewer using the Refresh Diff (<img src="images/refresh.png"
            alt="refresh diff button" height="16" width="16">) and Update (<img
            src="images/update.png" alt="update button" height="16"
            width="16">) buttons. When you are finished comparing the files, you
            can commit your changes using the Diff Viewer's Commit button
            (<img src="images/commit.png" alt="commit button" height="16"
            width="16">).</p>
         
        <p>The Diff Viewer also enables you to select whether to view files containing 
            changes from the local working copy, the repository, as well as both 
            simultaneously. To change viewing criteria, click on the appropriate 
            icon:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><img src="images/locally_mod.png">: local working copy</li>
            <li><img src="images/remotely_mod.png">: repository</li>
            <li><img src="images/both_mod.png">: both local and remote files</li>            
        </ul>
            
        <p>The Diff Viewer highlights changes in the files using the following colors:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue</strong>. Indicates lines that have been changed since 
                the earlier revision.</li>
            <li> <strong>Green</strong>. Indicates lines that have been added since 
                the earlier revision.</li>
            <li><strong>Red</strong>. Indicates lines that have been removed since 
                the earlier revision.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To generate a graphical diff comparing a revision to your working copy:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Select a versioned file (e.g. in the Projects, Files, or Favorites 
                window).</li>
            <li>Choose Subversion &gt; Diff from the right-click menu. The IDE displays 
                the results in the Diff Viewer in a new tab of the main window.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can also perform a diff on files in the 
                <a href="csh/svn_versioning_window.html">Versioning</a> window. To 
                do so, select a file and choose Diff from the right-click menu.</li>
        </ul>
