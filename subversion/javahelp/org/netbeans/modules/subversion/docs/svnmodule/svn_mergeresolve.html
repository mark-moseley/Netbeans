        <p>When merge conflicts occur, a Merge Conflict badge (<img src="./images/conflicts-badge.png" 
            alt="Merge Conflict Badge">) appears on the parent folder (or package) of file. Within the 
            file itself, each conflict is marked with arrows followed by the lines from the two revisions 
            that caused the conflict.</p>
            
        <ul class="note">
            <li>Merge conflicts must be resolved prior to checking your local
            file into the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>To resolve merge conflicts graphically with the Merge Conflicts Resolver:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the Projects, Files, Subversion or Favorites window, select the node 
                of the file whose status indicates that there is a conflict and choose Resolve 
                Conflicts from the menu. The Merge Conflicts Resolver displays with merge conflicts
                highlighted in red.</li>
            <li>Use the Next (<img src="images/diff-next.png" alt="Next" height="16" width="16">) 
                and Previous (<img src="images/diff-prev.png" alt="Previous" height="16" width="16">) 
                difference buttons in the upper-left corner to navigate to each conflict in the file.</li>
            <li>For each conflict, click Accept above the pane containing the text that you wish to accept.
                Once you have chosen the correct text, it is highlighted in green and displayed in the 
                Merge Result pane. The text you did not choose is highlighted in blue.</li>
            <li>If neither pane contains the text you want, exit the Merge Conflict Resolver and edit 
                your source file manually. When you are done making changes, right-click the node of 
                the file and choose Subversion &gt; Update from the contextual menu. Then repeat the
                procedure, beginning with Step 1.</li>
            <li>After resolving each conflict, click OK to exit the Merge Conflict Resolver. The IDE 
                updates your local working copy with the desired changes.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="note">
            <li>Once you have resolved each merge conflict, you still need to
                commit the file to add your changes to the repository copy. For more
                information, see <a href="svn_commit.html">Committing Files to a
                Subversion Repository</a>.</li>
