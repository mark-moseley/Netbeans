        <h2>Subversion: Revert Modifications Dialog Box</h2>
        <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>
        <p>The Subversion Revert Modifications dialog box enables you to revert changes of a file or folder 
        in the repository to a previous revision.</p>
        <p>You access this dialog box by right-clicking a version-controlled file or folder and 
        choosing Subversion &gt; Revert Modifications.</p>
        
        <p>You can select one of three options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Revert Local Changes.</b> Reverts any changes made in your local working copy to the 
            previously committed or updated version.</li>
            <li><b>Revert Modifications from Single Commit.</b> Reverts the local working copy to the repository
            revision made prior to the previous commit. (Specify a revision number in the Revision text field.)</li>
            <li><b>Revert Modifications from Previous Commits.</b> Reverts the local working copy to a specified
            revision from the repository. (Specify starting and ending revision numbers in the corresponding text 
            fields.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can delete any files or folders which were created after the point which you are reverting to
            by selecting the <b>Remove Newly Added Files and Folders</b> option.</li>
        </ul>
