        <p>The Subversion Revert Modifications dialog box enables you to revert changes 
            of a file or folder in the repository to a previous revision.</p>
            
        <p>You access this dialog box by selecting a version-controlled file or folder 
            and choosing either Subversion &gt; Revert Modifications from the right-click
            menu or Versioning &gt; Revert Modifications from the IDE's main menu.</p>
        
        <p>You can select one of three options:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Revert Local Changes</strong>. Reverts any changes made in your 
                local working copy to the previously committed or updated version.</li>
            <li><strong>Revert Modifications from Single Commit</strong>. Reverts the 
                local working copy to the repository revision made prior to the previous 
                commit. (Specify a revision number in the Revision text field.)</li>
            <li><strong>Revert Modifications from Previous Commits</strong>. Reverts the 
                local working copy to a specified revision from the repository. (Specify 
                starting and ending revision numbers in the corresponding text fields.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul class="note">
            <li>You can delete any files or folders which were created in your local working 
                copy since the point which you are reverting to by selecting the <strong>Remove 
                Newly Added Files and Folders</strong> option.</li>
        </ul>
